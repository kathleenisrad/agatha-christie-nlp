# NLP on Agatha Christie Novels

## Executive Summary:

Some fans and experts believe that Agatha Christie had undiagnosed dementia in her later years. A paper published in 2009 looked at 14 of Agatha Christie's novels and found an increase in repeated phrase types, increase in indefinite word usage, and decrease in unique word types in her works as she aged.  
The goal of this project is to first replicate the findings of the paper using 70 of her novels instead of 14, and to dive deeper into analysis of her works.

## Data Source:
Agatha Christie's novels were downloaded in the ePUB format from the internet archive. They were converted to TXT files using the program Calibre.

## Findings:
I was able to replicate the paper's findings.
