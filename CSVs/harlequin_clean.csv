THE EDGE, clare halliwell walked down the short path that led from her cottage door to the gate on her arm was a basket and in the basket was a bottle of soup some homemade jelly and a few grapes there were not many poor people in the small village of daymers end but such as there were were assiduously looked after and clare was one of the most efficient of the parish workers clare halliwell was thirty two she had an upright carriage a healthy colour and nice brown eyes she was not beautiful but she looked fresh and pleasant and very english everybody liked her and said she was a good sort since her mothers death two years ago she had lived alone in the cottage with her dog rover she kept poultry and was fond of animals and of a healthy outdoor life as she unlatched the gate a two seater car swept past and the driver a girl in a red hat waved a greeting clare responded but for a moment her lips tightened she felt that pang at her heart which always came when she saw vivien lee geralds wife medenham grange which lay just a mile outside the village had belonged to the lees for many generations sir gerald lee the present owner of the grange was a man old for his years and considered by many stiff in manner his pomposity really covered a good deal of shyness he and clare had played together as children later they had been friends and a closer and dearer tie had been confidently expected by many including it may be said clare herself there was no hurry of course but some day    she left it so in her own mind some day and then just a year ago the village had been startled by the news of sir geralds marriage to a miss harper a girl nobody had ever heard of the new lady lee had not been popular in the village she took not the faintest interest in parochial matters was bored by hunting and loathed the country and outdoor sports many of the wiseacres shook their heads and wondered how it would end it was easy to see where sir geralds infatuation had come in vivien was a beauty from head to foot she was a complete contrast to clare halliwell small elfin dainty with golden red hair that curled enchantingly over her pretty ears and big violet eyes that could shoot a sideways glance of provocation to the manner born gerald lee in his simple mans way had been anxious that his wife and clare should be great friends clare was often asked to dine at the grange and vivien made a pretty pretence of affectionate intimacy whenever they met hence that gay salutation of hers this morning clare walked on and did her errand the vicar was also visiting the old woman in question and he and clare walked a few yards together afterwards before their ways parted they stood still for a minute discussing parish affairs jones has broken out again im afraid said the vicar and i had such hopes after he had volunteered of his own accord to take the pledge disgusting said clare crisply it seems so to us said mr wilmot but we must remember that it is very hard to put ourselves in his place and realize his temptation the desire for drink is unaccountable to us but we all have our own temptations and thus we can understand i suppose we have said clare uncertainly the vicar glanced at her some of us have the good fortune to be very little tempted he said gently but even to those people their hour comes watch and pray remember that ye enter not into temptation then bidding her goodbye he walked briskly away clare went on thoughtfully and presently she almost bumped into sir gerald lee hullo clare i was hoping to run across you you look jolly fit what a colour youve got the colour had not been there a minute before lee went on as i say i was hoping to run across you viviens got to go off to bournemouth for the weekend her mothers not well can you dine with us tuesday instead of tonight oh yes tuesday will suit me just as well thats all right then splendid i must hurry along clare went home to find her one faithful domestic standing on the doorstep looking out for her there you are miss such a to do theyve brought rover home he went off on his own this morning and a car ran clean over him clare hurried to the dogs side she adored animals and rover was her especial darling she felt his legs one by one and then ran her hands over his body he groaned once or twice and licked her hand if theres any serious injury its internal she said at last no bones seem to be broken shall we get the vet to see him miss clare shook her head she had little faith in the local vet well wait until tomorrow he doesnt seem to be in great pain and his gums are a good colour so there cant be much internal bleeding tomorrow if i dont like the look of him ill take him over to skippington in the car and let reeves have a look at him hes far and away the best man on the following day rover seemed weaker and clare duly carried out her project the small town of skippington was about forty miles away a long run but reeves the vet there was celebrated for many miles round he diagnosed certain internal injuries but held out good hopes of recovery and clare went away quite content to leave rover in his charge there was only one hotel of any pretensions in skippington the county arms it was mainly frequented by commercial travellers for there was no good hunting country near skippington and it was off the track of the main roads for motorists lunch was not served till one oclock and as it wanted a few minutes of that hour clare amused herself by glancing over the entries in the open visitors book suddenly she gave a stifled exclamation surely she knew that handwriting with its loops and whirls and flourishes she had always considered it unmistakable even now she could have sworn but of course it was clearly impossible vivien lee was at bournemouth the entry itself showed it to be impossible mr and mrs cyril brown london but in spite of herself her eyes strayed back again and again to that curly writing and on an impulse she could not quite define she asked abruptly of the woman in the office mrs cyril brown i wonder if that is the same one i know a small lady reddish hair very pretty she came in a red two seater car madam a peugeot i believe then it was a coincidence would be too remarkable as if in a dream she heard the woman go on they were here just over a month ago for a weekend and liked it so much that they have come again newly married i should fancy clare heard herself saying thank you i dont think that could be my friend her voice sounded different as though it belonged to someone else presently she was sitting in the dining room quietly eating cold roast beef her mind a maze of conflicting thought and emotions she had no doubts whatever she had summed vivien up pretty correctly on their first meeting vivien was that kind she wondered vaguely who the man was someone vivien had known before her marriage very likely it didnt matter nothing mattered but gerald what was she clare to do about gerald he ought to know surely he ought to know it was clearly her duty to tell him she had discovered viviens secret by accident but she must lose no time in acquainting gerald with the facts she was geralds friend not viviens but somehow or other she felt uncomfortable her conscience was not satisfied on the face of it her reasoning was good but duty and inclination jumped suspiciously together she admitted to herself that she disliked vivien besides if gerald lee were to divorce his wife and clare had no doubts at all that that was exactly what he would do he was a man with an almost fanatical view of his own honour then well the way would lie open for gerald to come to her put like that she shrank back fastidiously her own proposed action seemed naked and ugly the personal element entered in too much she could not be sure of her own motives clare was essentially a high minded conscientious woman she strove now very earnestly to see where her duty lay she wished as she had always wished to do right what was right in this case what was wrong by a pure accident she had come into possession of facts that affected vitally the man she loved and the woman whom she disliked and yes one might as well be frank of whom she was bitterly jealous she could ruin that woman was she justified in doing so clare had always held herself aloof from the backbiting and scandal which is an inevitable part of village life she hated to feel that she now resembled one of those human ghouls she had always professed to despise suddenly the vicars words that morning flashed across her mind even to those people their hour comes was this her hour was this her temptation had it come insidiously disguised as a duty she was clare halliwell a christian in love and charity with all men and women if she were to tell gerald she must be quite sure that only impersonal motives guided her for the present she would say nothing she paid her bill for luncheon and drove away feeling an indescribable lightening of spirit indeed she felt happier than she had done for a long time she felt glad that she had had the strength to resist temptation to do nothing mean or unworthy just for a second it flashed across her mind that it might be a sense of power that had so lightened her spirits but she dismissed the idea as fantastic by tuesday night she was strengthened in her resolve the revelation could not come through her she must keep silence her own secret love for gerald made speech impossible rather a high minded view to take perhaps but it was the only one possible for her she arrived at the grange in her own little car sir geralds chauffeur was at the front door to drive it round to the garage after she had alighted as the night was a wet one he had just driven off when clare remembered some books which she had borrowed and had brought with her to return she called out but the man did not hear her the butler ran out after the car so for a minute or two clare was alone in the hall close to the door of the drawing room which the butler had just unlatched prior to announcing her those inside the room however knew nothing of her arrival and so it was that viviens voice high pitched not quite the voice of a lady rang out clearly and distinctly oh were only waiting for clare halliwell you must know her lives in the village supposed to be one of the local belles but frightfully unattractive really she tried her best to catch gerald but he wasnt having any oh yes darling this in answer to a murmured protest from her husband she did you maynt be aware of the fact but she did her very utmost poor old clare a good sort but such a dump clares face went dead white her hands hanging against her sides clenched themselves in anger such as she had never known before at that moment she could have murdered vivien lee it was only by a supreme physical effort that she regained control of herself that and the half formed thought that she held it in her power to punish vivien for those cruel words the butler had returned with the books he opened the door announced her and in another moment she was greeting a roomful of people in her usual pleasant manner vivien exquisitely dressed in some dark wine colour that showed off her white fragility was particularly affectionate and gushing they didnt see half enough of clare she vivien was going to learn golf and clare must come out with her on the links gerald was very attentive and kind though he had no suspicion that she had overheard his wifes words he had some vague idea of making up for them he was very fond of clare and he wished vivien wouldnt say the things she did he and clare had been friends nothing more and if there was an uneasy suspicion at the back of his mind that he was shirking the truth in that last statement he put it away from him after dinner the talk fell on dogs and clare recounted rovers accident she purposely waited for a lull in the conversation to say    so on saturday i took him to skippington she heard the sudden rattle of vivien lees coffee cup on the saucer but she did not look at her yet to see that man reeves yes hell be all right i think i had lunch at the county arms afterwards rather a decent little pub she turned now to vivien have you ever stayed there if she had had any doubts they were swept aside viviens answer came quick in stammering haste i oh n no no fear was in her eyes they were wide and dark with it as they met clares clares eyes told nothing they were calm scrutinizing no one could have dreamt of the keen pleasure that they veiled at that moment clare almost forgave vivien for the words she had overheard earlier in the evening she tasted in that moment a fullness of power that almost made her head reel she held vivien lee in the hollow of her hand the following day she received a note from the other woman would clare come up and have tea with her quietly that afternoon clare refused then vivien called on her twice she came at hours when clare was almost certain to be at home on the first occasion clare really was out on the second she slipped out by the back way when she saw vivien coming up the path shes not sure yet whether i know or not she said to herself she wants to find out without committing herself but she shant not until im ready clare hardly knew herself what she was waiting for she had decided to keep silence that was the only straight and honourable course she felt an additional glow of virtue when she remembered the extreme provocation she had received after overhearing the way vivien talked of her behind her back a weaker character she felt might have abandoned her good resolutions she went twice to church on sunday first to early communion from which she came out strengthened and uplifted no personal feelings should weigh with her nothing mean or petty she went again to morning service mr wilmot preached on the famous prayer of the pharisee he sketched the life of that man a good man pillar of the church and he pictured the slow creeping blight of spiritual pride that distorted and soiled all that he was clare did not listen very attentively vivien was in the big square pew of the lee family and clare knew by instinct that the other intended to get hold of her afterwards so it fell out vivien attached herself to clare walked home with her and asked if she might come in clare of course assented they sat in clares little sitting room bright with flowers and old fashioned chintzes viviens talk was desultory and jerky i was at bournemouth you know last weekend she remarked presently gerald told me so said clare they looked at each other vivien appeared almost plain today her face had a sharp foxy look that robbed it of much of its charm when you were at skippington  began vivien when i was at skippington echoed clare politely you were speaking about some little hotel there the county arms yes you didnt know it you said i i have been there once oh she had only to keep still and wait vivien was quite unfitted to bear a strain of any kind already she was breaking down under it suddenly she leant forward and spoke vehemently you dont like me you never have youve always hated me youre enjoying yourself now playing with me like a cat with a mouse youre cruel cruel thats why im afraid of you because deep down youre cruel really vivien said clare sharply you know dont you yes i can see that you know you knew that night when you spoke about skippington youve found out somehow well i want to know what you are going to do about it what are you going to do clare did not reply for a minute and vivien sprang to her feet what are you going to do i must know youre not going to deny that you know all about it i do not propose to deny anything said clare coldly you saw me there that day no i saw your handwriting in the book mr and mrs cyril brown vivien flushed darkly since then continued clare quietly i have made inquiries i find that you were not at bournemouth that weekend your mother never sent for you exactly the same thing happened about six weeks previously vivien sank down again on the sofa she burst into furious crying the crying of a frightened child what are you going to do she gasped are you going to tell gerald i dont know yet said clare she felt calm omnipotent vivien sat up pushing the red curls back from her forehead would you like to hear all about it it would be as well i think vivien poured out the whole story there was no reticence in her cyril brown was cyril haviland a young engineer to whom she had previously been engaged his health failed and he lost his job whereupon he made no bones about jilting the penniless vivien and marrying a rich widow many years older than himself soon afterwards vivien married gerald lee she had met cyril again by chance that was the first of many meetings cyril backed by his wifes money was prospering in his career and becoming a well known figure it was a sordid story a story of backstairs meeting of ceaseless lying and intrigue i love him so vivien repeated again and again with a sudden moan and each time the words made clare feel physically sick at last the stammering recital came to an end vivien muttered a shamefaced well what am i going to do asked clare i cant tell you i must have time to think you wont give me away to gerald it may be my duty to do so no no viviens voice rose to a hysterical shriek hell divorce me he wont listen to a word hell find out from that hotel and cyril will be dragged into it and then his wife will divorce him everything will go his career his health hell be penniless again hed never forgive me never if youll excuse my saying so said clare i dont think much of this cyril of yours vivien paid no attention i tell you hell hate me hate me i cant bear it dont tell gerald ill do anything you like but dont tell gerald i must have time to decide said clare gravely i cant promise anything offhand in the meantime you and cyril mustnt meet again no no we wont i swear it when i know whats the right thing to do said clare ill let you know she got up vivien went out of the house in a furtive slinking way glancing back over her shoulder clare wrinkled her nose in disgust a beastly affair would vivien keep her promise not to see cyril probably not she was weak rotten all through that afternoon clare went for a long walk there was a path which led along the downs on the left the green hills sloped gently down to the sea far below while the path wound steadily upward this walk was known locally as the edge though safe enough if you kept to the path it was dangerous to wander from it those insidious gentle slopes were dangerous clare had lost a dog there once the animal had gone racing over the smooth grass gaining momentum had been unable to stop and had gone over the edge of the cliff to be dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks below the afternoon was clear and beautiful from far below there came the ripple of the sea a soothing murmur clare sat down on the short green turf and stared out over the blue water she must face this thing clearly what did she mean to do she thought of vivien with a kind of disgust how the girl had crumpled up how abjectly she had surrendered clare felt a rising contempt she had no pluck no grit nevertheless much as she disliked vivien clare decided that she would continue to spare her for the present when she got home she wrote a note to her saying that although she could make no definite promise for the future she had decided to keep silence for the present life went on much the same in daymers end it was noticed locally that lady lee was looking far from well on the other hand clare halliwell bloomed her eyes were brighter she carried her head higher and there was a new confidence and assurance in her manner she and lady lee often met and it was noticed on these occasions that the younger woman watched the older with a flattering attention to her slightest word sometimes miss halliwell would make remarks that seemed a little ambiguous not entirely relevant to the matter in hand she would suddenly say that she had changed her mind about many things lately that it was curious how a little thing might alter ones point of view entirely one was apt to give way too much to pity and that was really quite wrong when she said things of that kind she usually looked at lady lee in a peculiar way and the latter would suddenly grow quite white and look almost terrified but as the year drew on these little subtleties became less apparent clare continued to make the same remarks but lady lee seemed less affected by them she began to recover her looks and spirits her old gay manner returned one morning when she was taking her dog for a walk clare met gerald in a lane the latters spaniel fraternized with rover while his master talked to clare heard our news he said buoyantly i expect viviens told you what sort of news vivien hasnt mentioned anything in particular were going abroad for a year perhaps longer viviens fed up with this place she never has cared for it you know he sighed for a moment or two he looked downcast gerald lee was very proud of his home anyway ive promised her a change ive taken a villa near algiers a wonderful place by all accounts he laughed a little self consciously quite a second honeymoon eh for a minute or two clare could not speak something seemed to be rising up in her throat and suffocating her she could see the white walls of the villa the orange trees smell the soft perfumed breath of the south a second honeymoon they were going to escape vivien no longer believed in her threats she was going away carefree gay happy clare heard her own voice a little hoarse in timbre saying the appropriate things how lovely she envied them mercifully at that moment rover and the spaniel decided to disagree in the scuffle that ensued further conversation was out of the question that afternoon clare sat down and wrote a note to vivien she asked her to meet her on the edge the following day as she had something very important to say to her the next morning dawned bright and cloudless clare walked up the steep path of the edge with a lightened heart what a perfect day she was glad that she had decided to say what had to be said out in the open under the blue sky instead of in her stuffy little sitting room she was sorry for vivien very sorry indeed but the thing had got to be done she saw a yellow dot like some yellow flower higher up by the side of the path as she came nearer it resolved itself into the figure of vivien dressed in a yellow knitted frock sitting on the short turf her hands clasped round her knees good morning said clare isnt it a perfect morning is it said vivien i havent noticed what was it you wanted to say to me clare dropped down on the grass beside her im quite out of breath she said apologetically its a steep pull up here damn you cried vivien shrilly why cant you say it you smooth faced devil instead of torturing me clare looked shocked and vivien hastily recanted i didnt mean that im sorry clare i am indeed only my nerves are all to pieces and your sitting here and talking about the weather well it got me all rattled youll have a nervous breakdown if youre not careful said clare coldly vivien gave a short laugh go over the edge no im not that kind ill never be a loony now tell me whats all this about clare was silent for a moment then she spoke looking not at vivien but steadily out over the sea i thought it only fair to warn you that i can no longer keep silence about about what happened last year you mean youll go to gerald with the whole story unless youll tell him yourself that would be infinitely the better way vivien laughed sharply you know well enough i havent got the pluck to do that clare did not contradict the assertion she had had proof before of viviens utterly craven temper it would be infinitely better she repeated again vivien gave that short ugly laugh its your precious conscience i suppose that drives you to do this she sneered i dare say it seems very strange to you said clare quietly but it honestly is that viviens white set face stared into hers my god she said i really believe you mean it too you actually think thats the reason it is the reason no it isnt if so youd have done it before long ago why didnt you no dont answer ill tell you you got more pleasure out of holding it over me thats why you liked to keep me on tenterhooks and make me wince and squirm youd say things diabolical things just to torment me and keep me perpetually on the jump and so they did for a bit till i got used to them you got to feel secure said clare you saw that didnt you but even then you held back enjoying your sense of power but now were going away escaping from you perhaps even going to be happy you couldnt stick that at any price so your convenient conscience wakes up she stopped panting clare said still very quietly i cant prevent your saying all these fantastical things but i can assure you theyre not true vivien turned suddenly and caught her by the hand clare for gods sake ive been straight ive done what you said ive not seen cyril again i swear it thats nothing to do with it clare havent you any pity any kindness ill go down on my knees to you tell gerald yourself if you tell him he may forgive you vivien laughed scornfully you know gerald better than that hell be rabid vindictive hell make me suffer hell make cyril suffer thats what i cant bear listen clare hes doing so well hes invented something machinery i dont understand about it but it may be a wonderful success hes working it out now his wife supplies the money for it of course but shes suspicious jealous if she finds out and she will find out if gerald starts proceedings for divorce shell chuck cyril his work everything cyril will be ruined im not thinking of cyril said clare im thinking of gerald why dont you think a little of him too gerald i dont care that  she snapped her fingers for gerald i never have we might as well have the truth now were at it but i do care for cyril im a rotter through and through i admit it i dare say hes a rotter too but my feeling for him that isnt rotten id die for him do you hear id die for him that is easily said said clare derisively you think im not in earnest listen if you go on with this beastly business ill kill myself sooner than have cyril brought into it and ruined id do that clare remained unimpressed you dont believe me said vivien panting suicide needs a lot of courage vivien flinched back as though she had been struck youve got me there yes ive no pluck if there were an easy way  theres an easy way in front of you said clare youve only got to run straight down that green slope it would be all over in a couple of minutes remember that child last year yes said vivien thoughtfully that would be easy quite easy if one really wanted to  clare laughed vivien turned to her lets have this out once more cant you see that by keeping silence as long as you have youve youve no right to go back on it now ill not see cyril again ill be a good wife to gerald i swear i will or ill go away and never see him again whichever you like clare  clare got up i advise you she said to tell your husband yourself    otherwise i shall i see said vivien softly well i cant let cyril suffer    she got up stood still as though considering for a minute or two then ran lightly down to the path but instead of stopping crossed it and went down the slope once she half turned her head and waved a hand gaily to clare then she ran on gaily lightly as a child might run out of sight    clare stood petrified suddenly she heard cries shouts a clamour of voices then silence she picked her way stiffly down to the path about a hundred yards away a party of people coming up it had stopped they were staring and pointing clare ran down and joined them yes miss someones fallen over the cliff two men have gone down to see she waited was it an hour or eternity or only a few minutes a man came toiling up the ascent it was the vicar in his shirt sleeves his coat had been taken off to cover what lay below horrible he said his face was very white mercifully death must have been instantaneous he saw clare and came over to her this must have been a terrible shock to you you were taking a walk together i understand clare heard herself answering mechanically yes they had just parted no lady lees manner had been quite normal one of the group interposed the information that the lady was laughing and waving her hand a terribly dangerous place there ought to be a railing along the path the vicars voice rose again an accident yes clearly an accident and then suddenly clare laughed a hoarse raucous laugh that echoed along the cliff thats a damned lie she said i killed her she felt someone patting her shoulder a voice spoke soothingly there there its all right youll be all right presently but clare was not all right presently she was never all right again she persisted in the delusion certainly a delusion since at least eight persons had witnessed the scene that she had killed vivien lee she was very miserable till nurse lauriston came to take charge nurse lauriston was very successful with mental cases humour them poor things she would say comfortably so she told clare that she was a wardress from pentonville prison clares sentence she said had been commuted to penal servitude for life a room was fitted up as a cell and now i think we shall be quite happy and comfortable said nurse lauriston to the doctor round bladed knives if you like doctor but i dont think theres the least fear of suicide shes not the type too self centred funny how those are often the ones who go over the edge most easily two ,1927,515,7179,5660,88.3753667364232,10.990291262135923,1.268374558303887, clare halliwell walked down the

clearly her duty to tell him she had discovered viviens secret by accident but she must lose no time in acquainting gerald with the facts she was geralds friend not viviens but somehow or other she felt uncomfortable her conscience was not satisfied on the face of it her reasoning was good but duty and inclination jumped suspiciously together she admitted to herself that she disliked vivien besides if gerald lee were to divorce his wife and clare had no doubts at all that that was exactly what he would do he was a man with an almost fanatical view of his own honour then well the way would lie open for gerald to come to her put like that she shrank back fastidiously her own proposed action seemed naked and ugly the personal element entered in too much she could not be sure of her own motives clare was essentially a high minded conscientious woman she strove now very earnestly to see where her duty lay she wished as she had always wished to do right what was right in this case what was wrong by a pure accident she had come into possession of facts that affected vitally the man she loved and the woman whom she disliked and yes one might as well be frank of whom she was bitterly jealous she could ruin that woman was she justified in doing so clare had always held herself aloof from the backbiting and scandal which is an inevitable part of village life she hated to feel that she now resembled one of those human ghouls she had always professed to despise suddenly the vicars words that morning flashed across her mind even to those people their hour comes was this her hour was this her temptation had it come insidiously disguised as a duty she was clare halliwell a christian in love and charity with all men and women if she were to tell gerald she must be quite sure that only impersonal motives guided her for the present she would say nothing she paid her bill for luncheon and drove away feeling an indescribable lightening of spirit indeed she felt happier than she had done for a long time she felt glad that she had had the strength to resist temptation to do nothing mean or unworthy just for a second it flashed across her mind that it might be a sense of power that had so lightened her spirits but she dismissed the idea as fantastic by tuesday night she was strengthened in her resolve the revelation could not come through her she must keep silence her own secret love for gerald made speech impossible rather a high minded view to take perhaps but it was the only one possible for her she arrived at the grange in her own little car sir geralds chauffeur was at the front door to drive it round to the garage after she had alighted as the night was a wet one he had just driven off when clare remembered some books which she had borrowed and had brought with her to return she called out but the man did not hear her the butler ran out after the car so for a minute or two clare was alone in the hall close to the door of the drawing room which the butler had just unlatched prior to announcing her those inside the room however knew nothing of her arrival and so it was that viviens voice high pitched not quite the voice of a lady rang out clearly and distinctly oh were only waiting for clare halliwell you must know her lives in the village supposed to be one of the local belles but frightfully unattractive really she tried her best to catch gerald but he wasnt having any oh yes darling this in answer to a murmured protest from her husband she did you maynt be aware of the fact but she did her very utmost poor old clare a good sort but such a dump clares face went dead white her hands hanging against her sides clenched themselves in anger such as she had never known before at that moment she could have murdered vivien lee it was only by a supreme physical effort that she regained control of herself that and the half formed thought that she held it in her power to punish vivien for those cruel words the butler had returned with the books he opened the door announced her and in another moment she was greeting a roomful of people in her usual pleasant manner vivien exquisitely dressed in some dark wine colour that showed off her white fragility was particularly affectionate and gushing they didnt see half enough of clare she vivien was going to learn golf and clare must come out with her on the links gerald was very attentive and kind though he had no suspicion that she had overheard his wifes words he had some vague idea of making up for them he was very fond of clare and he wished vivien wouldnt say the things she did he and clare had been friends nothing more and if there was an uneasy suspicion at the back of his mind that he was shirking the truth in that last statement he put it away from him after dinner the talk fell on dogs and clare recounted rovers accident she purposely waited for a lull in the conversation to say    so on saturday i took him to skippington she heard the sudden rattle of vivien lees coffee cup on the saucer but she did not look at her yet to see that man reeves yes hell be all right i think i had lunch at the county arms afterwards rather a decent little pub she turned now to vivien have you ever stayed there if she had had any doubts they were swept aside viviens answer came quick in stammering haste i oh n no no fear was in her eyes they were wide and dark with it as they met clares clares eyes told nothing they were calm scrutinizing no one could have dreamt of the keen pleasure that they veiled at that moment clare almost forgave vivien for the words she had overheard earlier in the evening she tasted in that moment a fullness of power that almost made her head reel she held vivien lee in the hollow of her hand the following day she received a note from the other woman would clare come up and have tea with her quietly that afternoon clare refused then vivien called on her twice she came at hours when clare was almost certain to be at home on the first occasion clare really was out on the second she slipped out by the back way when she saw vivien coming up the path shes not sure yet whether i know or not she said to herself she wants to find out without committing herself but she shant not until im ready clare hardly knew herself what she was waiting for she had decided to keep silence that was the only straight and honourable course she felt an additional glow of virtue when she remembered the extreme provocation she had received after overhearing the way vivien talked of her behind her back a weaker character she felt might have abandoned her good resolutions she went twice to church on sunday first to early communion from which she came out strengthened and uplifted no personal feelings should weigh with her nothing mean or petty she went again to morning service mr wilmot preached on the famous prayer of the pharisee he sketched the life of that man a good man pillar of the church and he pictured the slow creeping blight of spiritual pride that distorted and soiled all that he was clare did not listen very attentively vivien was in the big square pew of the lee family and clare knew by instinct that the other intended to get hold of her afterwards so it fell out vivien attached herself to clare walked home with her and asked if she might come in clare of course assented they sat in clares little sitting room bright with flowers and old fashioned chintzes viviens talk was desultory and jerky i was at bournemouth you know last weekend she remarked presently gerald told me so said clare they looked at each other vivien appeared almost plain today her face had a sharp foxy look that robbed it of much of its charm when you were at skippington  began vivien when i was at skippington echoed clare politely you were speaking about some little hotel there the county arms yes you didnt know it you said i i have been there once oh she had only to keep still and wait vivien was quite unfitted to bear a strain of any kind already she was breaking down under it suddenly she leant forward and spoke vehemently you dont like me you never have youve always hated me youre enjoying yourself now playing with me like a cat with a mouse youre cruel cruel thats why im afraid of you because deep down youre cruel really vivien said clare sharply you know dont you yes i can see that you know you knew that night when you spoke about skippington youve found out somehow well i want to know what you are going to do about it what are you going to do clare did not reply for a minute and vivien sprang to her feet what are you going to do i must know youre not going to deny that you know all about it i do not propose to deny anything said clare coldly you saw me there that day no i saw your handwriting in the book mr and mrs cyril brown vivien flushed darkly since then continued clare quietly i have made inquiries i find that you were not at bournemouth that weekend your mother never sent for you exactly the same thing happened about six weeks previously vivien sank down again on the sofa she burst into furious crying the crying of a frightened child what are you going to do she gasped are you going to tell gerald i dont know yet said clare she felt calm omnipotent vivien sat up pushing the red curls back from her forehead would you like to hear all about it it would be as well i think vivien poured out the whole story there was no reticence in her cyril brown was cyril haviland a young engineer to whom she had previously been engaged his health failed and he lost his job whereupon he made no bones about jilting the penniless vivien and marrying a rich widow many years older than himself soon afterwards vivien married gerald lee she had met cyril again by chance that was the first of many meetings cyril backed by his wifes money was prospering in his career and becoming a well known figure it was a sordid story a story of backstairs meeting of ceaseless lying and intrigue i love him so vivien repeated again and again with a sudden moan and each time the words made clare feel physically sick at last the stammering recital came to an end vivien muttered a shamefaced well what am i going to do asked clare i cant tell you i must have time to think you wont give me away to gerald it may be my duty to do so no no viviens voice rose to a hysterical shriek hell divorce me he wont listen to a word hell find out from that hotel and cyril will be dragged into it and then his wife will divorce him everything will go his career his health hell be penniless again hed never forgive me never if youll excuse my saying so said clare i dont think much of this cyril of yours vivien paid no attention i tell you hell hate me hate me i cant bear it dont tell gerald ill do anything you like but dont tell gerald i must have time to decide said clare gravely i cant promise anything offhand in the meantime you and cyril mustnt meet again no no we wont i swear it when i know whats the right thing to do said clare ill let you know she got up vivien went out of the house in a furtive slinking way glancing back over her shoulder clare wrinkled her nose in disgust a beastly affair would vivien keep her promise not to see cyril probably not she was weak rotten all through that afternoon clare went for a long walk there was a path which led along the downs on the left the green hills sloped gently down to the sea far below while the path wound steadily upward this walk was known locally as the edge though safe enough if you kept to the path it was dangerous to wander from it those insidious gentle slopes were dangerous clare had lost a dog there once the animal had gone racing over the smooth grass gaining momentum had been unable to stop and had gone over the edge of the cliff to be dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks below the afternoon was clear and beautiful from far below there came the ripple of the sea a soothing murmur clare sat down on the short green turf and stared out over the blue water she must face this thing clearly what did she mean to do she thought of vivien with a kind of disgust how the girl had crumpled up how abjectly she had surrendered clare felt a rising contempt she had no pluck no grit nevertheless much as she disliked vivien clare decided that she would continue to spare her for the present when she got home she wrote a note to her saying that although she could make no definite promise for the future she had decided to keep silence for the present life went on much the same in daymers end it was noticed locally that lady lee was looking far from well on the other hand clare halliwell bloomed her eyes were brighter she carried her head higher and there was a new confidence and assurance in her manner she and lady lee often met and it was noticed on these occasions that the younger woman watched the older with a flattering attention to her slightest word sometimes miss halliwell would make remarks that seemed a little ambiguous not entirely relevant to the matter in hand she would suddenly say that she had changed her mind about many things lately that it was curious how a little thing might alter ones point of view entirely one was apt to give way too much to pity and that was really quite wrong when she said things of that kind she usually looked at lady lee in a peculiar way and the latter would suddenly grow quite white and look almost terrified but as the year drew on these little subtleties became less apparent clare continued to make the same remarks but lady lee seemed less affected by them she began to recover her looks and spirits her old gay manner returned one morning when she was taking her dog for a walk clare met gerald in a lane the latters spaniel fraternized with rover while his master talked to clare heard our news he said buoyantly i expect viviens told you what sort of news vivien hasnt mentioned anything in particular were going abroad for a year perhaps longer viviens fed up with this place she never has cared for it you know he sighed for a moment or two he looked downcast gerald lee was very proud of his home anyway ive promised her a change ive taken a villa near algiers a wonderful place by all accounts he laughed a little self consciously quite a second honeymoon eh for a minute or two clare could not speak something seemed to be rising up in her throat and suffocating her she could see the white walls of the villa the orange trees smell the soft perfumed breath of the south a second honeymoon they were going to escape vivien no longer believed in her threats she was going away carefree gay happy clare heard her own voice a little hoarse in timbre saying the appropriate things how lovely she envied them mercifully at that moment rover and the spaniel decided to disagree in the scuffle that ensued further conversation was out of the question that afternoon clare sat down and wrote a note to vivien she asked her to meet her on the edge the following day as she had something very important to say to her the next morning dawned bright and cloudless clare walked up the steep path of the edge with a lightened heart what a perfect day she was glad that she had decided to say what had to be said out in the open under the blue sky instead of in her stuffy little sitting room she was sorry for vivien very sorry indeed but the thing had got to be done she saw a yellow dot like some yellow flower higher up by the side of the path as she came nearer it resolved itself into the figure of vivien dressed in a yellow knitted frock sitting on the short turf her hands clasped round her knees good morning said clare isnt it a perfect morning is it said vivien i havent noticed what was it you wanted to say to me clare dropped down on the grass beside her im quite out of breath she said apologetically its a steep pull up here damn you cried vivien shrilly why cant you say it you smooth faced devil instead of torturing me clare looked shocked and vivien hastily recanted i didnt mean that im sorry clare i am indeed only my nerves are all to pieces and your sitting here and talking about the weather well it got me all rattled youll have a nervous breakdown if youre not careful said clare coldly vivien gave a short laugh go over the edge no im not that kind ill never be a loony now tell me whats all this about clare was silent for a moment then she spoke looking not at vivien but steadily out over the sea i thought it only fair to warn you that i can no longer keep silence about about what happened last year you mean youll go to gerald with the whole story unless youll tell him yourself that would be infinitely the better way vivien laughed sharply you know well enough i havent got the pluck to do that clare did not contradict the assertion she had had proof before of viviens utterly craven temper it would be infinitely better she repeated again vivien gave that short ugly laugh its your precious conscience i suppose that drives you to do this she sneered i dare say it seems very strange to you said clare quietly but it honestly is that viviens white set face stared into hers my god she said i really believe you mean it too you actually think thats the reason it is the reason no it isnt if so youd have done it before long ago why didnt you no dont answer ill tell you you got more pleasure out of holding it over me thats why you liked to keep me on tenterhooks and make me wince and squirm youd say things diabolical things just to torment me and keep me perpetually on the jump and so they did for a bit till i got used to them you got to feel secure said clare you saw that didnt you but even then you held back enjoying your sense of power but now were going away escaping from you perhaps even going to be happy you couldnt stick that at any price so your convenient conscience wakes up she stopped panting clare said still very quietly i cant prevent your saying all these fantastical things but i can assure you theyre not true vivien turned suddenly and caught her by the hand clare for gods sake ive been straight ive done what you said ive not seen cyril again i swear it thats nothing to do with it clare havent you any pity any kindness ill go down on my knees to you tell gerald yourself if you tell him he may forgive you vivien laughed scornfully you know gerald better than that hell be rabid vindictive hell make me suffer hell make cyril suffer thats what i cant bear listen clare hes doing so well hes invented something machinery i dont understand about it but it may be a wonderful success hes working it out now his wife supplies the money for it of course but shes suspicious jealous if she finds out and she will find out if gerald starts proceedings for divorce shell chuck cyril his work everything cyril will be ruined im not thinking of cyril said clare im thinking of gerald why dont you think a little of him too gerald i dont care that  she snapped her fingers for gerald i never have we might as well have the truth now were at it but i do care for cyril im a rotter through and through i admit it i dare say hes a rotter too but my feeling for him that isnt rotten id die for him do you hear id die for him that is easily said said clare derisively you think im not in earnest listen if you go on with this beastly business ill kill myself sooner than have cyril brought into it and ruined id do that clare remained unimpressed you dont believe me said vivien panting suicide needs a lot of courage vivien flinched back as though she had been struck youve got me there yes ive no pluck if there were an easy way  theres an easy way in front of you said clare youve only got to run straight down that green slope it would be all over in a couple of minutes remember that child last year yes said vivien thoughtfully that would be easy quite easy if one really wanted to  clare laughed vivien turned to her lets have this out once more cant you see that by keeping silence as long as you have youve youve no right to go back on it now ill not see cyril again ill be a good wife to gerald i swear i will or ill go away and never see him again whichever you like clare  clare got up i advise you she said to tell your husband yourself    otherwise i shall i see said vivien softly well i cant let cyril suffer    she got up stood still as though considering for a minute or two then ran lightly down to the path but instead of stopping crossed it and went down the slope once she half turned her head and waved a hand gaily to clare then she ran on gaily lightly as a child might run out of sight    clare stood petrified suddenly she heard cries shouts a clamour of voices then silence she picked her way stiffly down to the path about a hundred yards away a party of people coming up it had stopped they were staring and pointing clare ran down and joined them yes miss someones fallen over the cliff two men have gone down to see she waited was it an hour or eternity or only a few minutes a man came toiling up the ascent it was the vicar in his shirt sleeves his coat had been taken off to cover what lay below horrible he said his face was very white mercifully death must have been instantaneous he saw clare and came over to her this must have been a terrible shock to you you were taking a walk together i understand clare heard herself answering mechanically yes they had just parted no lady lees manner had been quite normal one of the group interposed the information that the lady was laughing and waving her hand a terribly dangerous place there ought to be a railing along the path the vicars voice rose again an accident yes clearly an accident and then suddenly clare laughed a hoarse raucous laugh that echoed along the cliff thats a damned lie she said i killed her she felt someone patting her shoulder a voice spoke soothingly there there its all right youll be all right presently but clare was not all right presently she was never all right again she persisted in the delusion certainly a delusion since at least eight persons had witnessed the scene that she had killed vivien lee she was very miserable till nurse lauriston came to take charge nurse lauriston was very successful with mental cases humour them poor things she would say comfortably so she told clare that she was a wardress from pentonville prison clares sentence she said had been commuted to penal servitude for life a room was fitted up as a cell and now i think we shall be quite happy and comfortable said nurse lauriston to the doctor round bladed knives if you like doctor but i dont think theres the least fear of suicide shes not the type too self centred funny how those are often the ones who go over the edge most easily two

THE ACTRESS, the shabby man in the fourth row of the pit leant forward and stared incredulously at the stage his shifty eyes narrowed furtively nancy taylor he muttered by the lord little nancy taylor his glance dropped to the programme in his hand one name was printed in slightly larger type than the rest olga stormer so thats what she calls herself fancy yourself a star dont you my lady and you must be making a pretty little pot of money too quite forgotten your name was ever nancy taylor i daresay i wonder now i wonder now what youd say if jake levitt should remind you of the fact the curtain fell on the close of the first act hearty applause filled the auditorium olga stormer the great emotional actress whose name in a few short years had become a household word was adding yet another triumph to her list of successes as cora in the avenging angel jake levitt did not join in the clapping but a slow appreciative grin gradually distended his mouth god what luck just when he was on his beam ends too shed try to bluff it out he supposed but she couldnt put it over on him properly worked the thing was a gold mine on the following morning the first workings of jake levitts gold mine became apparent in her drawing room with its red lacquer and black hangings olga stormer read and reread a letter thoughtfully her pale face with its exquisitely mobile features was a little more set than usual and every now and then the grey green eyes under the level brows steadily envisaged the middle distance as though she contemplated the threat behind rather than the actual words of the letter in that wonderful voice of hers which could throb with emotion or be as clear cut as the click of a typewriter olga called miss jones a near young woman with spectacles a shorthand pad and a pencil clasped in her hand hastened from an adjoining room ring up mr danaham please and ask him to come round immediately syd danahan olga stormers manager entered the room with the usual apprehension of the man whose life it is to deal with and overcome the vagaries of the artistic feminine to coax to soothe to bully one at a time or all together such was his daily routine to his relief olga appeared calm and composed and merely flicked a note across the table to him read that the letter was scrawled in an illiterate hand on cheap paper dear madam i much appreciated your performance in the avenging angel last night i fancy we have a mutual friend in miss nancy taylor late of chicago an article regarding her is to be published shortly if you would care to discuss same i could call upon you at any time convenient to yourself yours respectfully jake levitt danahan looked slightly bewildered i dont quite get it who is this nancy taylor a girl who would be better dead danny there was bitterness in her voice and a weariness that revealed her  years a girl who was dead until this carrion crow brought her to life again oh then    me danny just me this means blackmail of course she nodded of course and by a man who knows the art thoroughly danahan frowned considering the matter olga her cheek pillowed on a long slender hand watched him with unfathomable eyes what about bluff deny everything he cant be sure that he hasnt been misled by a chance resemblance olga shook her head levitt makes his living by blackmailing women hes sure enough the police hinted danahan doubtfully her faint derisive smile was answer enough beneath her self control though he did not guess it was the impatience of the keen brain watching a slower brain laboriously cover the ground it had already traversed in a flash you dont er think it might be wise for you to er say something yourself to sir richard that would partly spike his guns the actresss engagement to sir richard everard mp had been announced a few weeks previously i told richard everything when he asked me to marry him my word that was clever of you said danahan admiringly olga smiled a little it wasnt cleverness danny dear you wouldnt understand all the same if this man levitt does what he threatens my number is up and incidentally richards parliamentary career goes smash too no as far as i can see there are only two things to do well to pay and that of course is endless or to disappear start again the weariness was again very apparent in her voice it isnt even as though id done anything i regretted i was a half starved little gutter waif danny striving to keep straight i shot a man a beast of a man who deserved to be shot the circumstances under which i killed him were such that no jury on earth would have convicted me i know that now but at the time i was only a frightened kid and i ran danahan nodded i suppose he said doubtfully theres nothing against this man levitt we could get hold of olga shook her head very unlikely hes too much of a coward to go in for evildoing the sound of her own words seemed to strike her a coward i wonder if we couldnt work on that in some way if sir richard were to see him and frighten him suggested danahan richard is too fine an instrument you cant handle that sort of man with gloves on well let me see him forgive me danny but i dont think youre subtle enough something between gloves and bare fists is needed let us say mittens that means a woman yes i rather fancy a woman might do the trick a woman with a certain amount of finesse but who knows the baser side of life from bitter experience olga stormer for instance dont talk to me ive got a plan coming she leant forward burying her face in her hands she lifted it suddenly whats the name of that girl who wants to understudy me margaret ryan isnt it the girl with the hair like mine her hairs all right admitted danahan grudgingly his eyes resting on the bronze gold coil surrounding olgas head its just like yours as you say but shes no good any other way i was going to sack her next week if all goes well youll probably have to let her understudy cora  she smothered his protests with a wave of her hand danny answer me one question honestly do you think i can act really act i mean or am i just an attractive woman who trails round in pretty dresses act my god olga theres been nobody like you since duse then if levitt is really a coward as i suspect the thing will come off no im not going to tell you about it i want you to get hold of the ryan girl tell her im interested in her and want her to dine here tomorrow night shell come fast enough i should say she would the other thing i want is some good strong knockout drops something that will put anyone out of action for an hour or two but leave them none the worse the next day danahan grinned i cant guarantee our friend wont have a headache but there will be no permanent damage done good run away now danny and leave the rest to me she raised her voice miss jones the spectacled young woman appeared with her usual alacrity take down this please walking slowly up and down olga dictated the days correspondence but one answer she wrote with her own hand jake levitt in his dingy room grinned as he tore open the expected envelope dear sir i cannot recall the lady of whom you speak but i meet so many people that my memory is necessarily uncertain i am always pleased to help any fellow actress and shall be at home if you will call this evening at nine oclock yours faithfully olga stormer levitt nodded appreciatively clever note she admitted nothing nevertheless she was willing to treat the gold mine was developing at nine oclock precisely levitt stood outside the door of the actresss flat and pressed the bell no one answered the summons and he was about to press it again when he realized that the door was not latched he pushed the door open and entered the hall to his right was an open door leading into a brilliantly lighted room a room decorated in scarlet and black levitt walked in on the table under the lamp lay a sheet of paper on which were written the words please wait until i return o stormer levitt sat down and waited in spite of himself a feeling of uneasiness was stealing over him the flat was so very quiet there was something eerie about the silence nothing wrong of course how could there be but the room was so deadly quiet and yet quiet as it was he had the preposterous uncomfortable notion that he wasnt alone in it absurd he wiped the perspiration from his brow and still the impression grew stronger he wasnt alone with a muttered oath he sprang up and began to pace up and down in a minute the woman would return and then  he stopped dead with a muffled cry from beneath the black velvet hangings that draped the window a hand protruded he stooped and touched it cold horribly cold a dead hand with a cry he flung back the curtains a woman was lying there one arm flung wide the other doubled under her as she lay face downwards her golden bronze hair lying in dishevelled masses on her neck olga stormer tremblingly his fingers sought the icy coldness of that wrist and felt for the pulse as he thought there was none she was dead she had escaped him then by taking the simplest way out suddenly his eyes were arrested by two ends of red cord finishing in fantastic tassels and half hidden by the masses of her hair he touched them gingerly the head sagged as he did so and he caught a glimpse of a horrible purple face he sprang back with a cry his head whirling there was something here he did not understand his brief glimpse of the face disfigured as it was had shown him one thing this was murder not suicide the woman had been strangled and she was not olga stormer ah what was that a sound behind him he wheeled round and looked straight into the terrified eyes of a maidservant crouching against the wall her face was as white as the cap and apron she wore but he did not understand the fascinated horror in her eyes until her half breathed words enlightened him to the peril in which he stood oh my gord youve killed er even then he did not quite realize he replied no no she was dead when i found her i saw yer do it you pulled the cord and strangled her i eard the gurgling cry she give the sweat broke out upon his brow in earnest his mind went rapidly over his actions of the previous few minutes she must have come in just as he had the two ends of cord in his hands she had seen the sagging head and had taken his own cry as coming from the victim he stared at her helplessly there was no doubting what he saw in her face terror and stupidity she would tell the police she had seen the crime committed and no cross examination would shake her he was sure of that she would swear away his life with the unshakable conviction that she was speaking the truth what a horrible unforeseen chain of circumstances stop was it unforeseen was there some devilry here on an impulse he said eyeing her narrowly thats not your mistress you know her answer given mechanically threw a light upon the situation no its er actress friend if you can call em friends seeing that they fought like cat and dog they were at it tonight ammer and tongs a trap he saw it now wheres your mistress went out ten minutes ago a trap and he had walked into it like a lamb a clever devil this olga stormer she had rid herself of a rival and he was to suffer for the deed murder my god they hanged a man for murder and he was innocent innocent a stealthy rustle recalled him the little maid was sidling towards the door her wits were beginning to work again her eyes wavered to the telephone then back to the door at all costs he must silence her it was the only way as well hang for a real crime as a fictitious one she had no weapon neither had he but he had his hands then his heart gave a leap on the table beside her almost under her hand lay a small jewelled revolver if he could reach it first  instinct or his eyes warned her she caught it up as he sprang and held it pointed at his breast awkwardly as she held it her finger was on the trigger and she could hardly miss him at that distance he stopped dead a revolver belonging to a woman like olga stormer would be pretty sure to be loaded but there was one thing she was no longer directly between him and the door so long as he did not attack her she might not have the nerve to shoot anyway he must risk it zig zagging he ran for the door through the hall and out through the outer door banging it behind him he heard her voice faint and shaky calling police murder shed have to call louder than that before anyone was likely to hear her hed got a start anyway down the stairs he went running down the open street then slacking to a walk as a stray pedestrian turned the corner he had his plan cut and dried to gravesend as quickly as possible a boat was sailing from there that night for the remoter parts of the world he knew the captain a man who for a consideration would ask no questions once on board and out to sea he would be safe at eleven oclock danahans telephone rang olgas voice spoke prepare a contract for miss ryan will you shes to understudy cora its absolutely no use arguing i owe her something after all the things i did to her tonight what yes i think im out of my troubles by the way if she tells you tomorrow that im an ardent spiritualist and put her into a trance tonight dont show open incredulity how knockout drops in the coffee followed by scientific passes after that i painted her face with purple grease paint and put a tourniquet on her left arm mystified well you must stay mystified until tomorrow i havent time to explain now i must get out of the cap and apron before my faithful maud returns from the pictures there was a beautiful drama on tonight she told me but she missed the best drama of all i played my best part tonight

she was willing to treat the gold mine was developing at nine oclock precisely levitt stood outside the door of the actresss flat and pressed the bell no one answered the summons and he was about to press it again when he realized that the door was not latched he pushed the door open and entered the hall to his right was an open door leading into a brilliantly lighted room a room decorated in scarlet and black levitt walked in on the table under the lamp lay a sheet of paper on which were written the words please wait until i return o stormer levitt sat down and waited in spite of himself a feeling of uneasiness was stealing over him the flat was so very quiet there was something eerie about the silence nothing wrong of course how could there be but the room was so deadly quiet and yet quiet as it was he had the preposterous uncomfortable notion that he wasnt alone in it absurd he wiped the perspiration from his brow and still the impression grew stronger he wasnt alone with a muttered oath he sprang up and began to pace up and down in a minute the woman would return and then  he stopped dead with a muffled cry from beneath the black velvet hangings that draped the window a hand protruded he stooped and touched it cold horribly cold a dead hand with a cry he flung back the curtains a woman was lying there one arm flung wide the other doubled under her as she lay face downwards her golden bronze hair lying in dishevelled masses on her neck olga stormer tremblingly his fingers sought the icy coldness of that wrist and felt for the pulse as he thought there was none she was dead she had escaped him then by taking the simplest way out suddenly his eyes were arrested by two ends of red cord finishing in fantastic tassels and half hidden by the masses of her hair he touched them gingerly the head sagged as he did so and he caught a glimpse of a horrible purple face he sprang back with a cry his head whirling there was something here he did not understand his brief glimpse of the face disfigured as it was had shown him one thing this was murder not suicide the woman had been strangled and she was not olga stormer ah what was that a sound behind him he wheeled round and looked straight into the terrified eyes of a maidservant crouching against the wall her face was as white as the cap and apron she wore but he did not understand the fascinated horror in her eyes until her half breathed words enlightened him to the peril in which he stood oh my gord youve killed er even then he did not quite realize he replied no no she was dead when i found her i saw yer do it you pulled the cord and strangled her i eard the gurgling cry she give the sweat broke out upon his brow in earnest his mind went rapidly over his actions of the previous few minutes she must have come in just as he had the two ends of cord in his hands she had seen the sagging head and had taken his own cry as coming from the victim he stared at her helplessly there was no doubting what he saw in her face terror and stupidity she would tell the police she had seen the crime committed and no cross examination would shake her he was sure of that she would swear away his life with the unshakable conviction that she was speaking the truth what a horrible unforeseen chain of circumstances stop was it unforeseen was there some devilry here on an impulse he said eyeing her narrowly thats not your mistress you know her answer given mechanically threw a light upon the situation no its er actress friend if you can call em friends seeing that they fought like cat and dog they were at it tonight ammer and tongs a trap he saw it now wheres your mistress went out ten minutes ago a trap and he had walked into it like a lamb a clever devil this olga stormer she had rid herself of a rival and he was to suffer for the deed murder my god they hanged a man for murder and he was innocent innocent a stealthy rustle recalled him the little maid was sidling towards the door her wits were beginning to work again her eyes wavered to the telephone then back to the door at all costs he must silence her it was the only way as well hang for a real crime as a fictitious one she had no weapon neither had he but he had his hands then his heart gave a leap on the table beside her almost under her hand lay a small jewelled revolver if he could reach it first  instinct or his eyes warned her she caught it up as he sprang and held it pointed at his breast awkwardly as she held it her finger was on the trigger and she could hardly miss him at that distance he stopped dead a revolver belonging to a woman like olga stormer would be pretty sure to be loaded but there was one thing she was no longer directly between him and the door so long as he did not attack her she might not have the nerve to shoot anyway he must risk it zig zagging he ran for the door through the hall and out through the outer door banging it behind him he heard her voice faint and shaky calling police murder shed have to call louder than that before anyone was likely to hear her hed got a start anyway down the stairs he went running down the open street then slacking to a walk as a stray pedestrian turned the corner he had his plan cut and dried to gravesend as quickly as possible a boat was sailing from there that night for the remoter parts of the world he knew the captain a man who for a consideration would ask no questions once on board and out to sea he would be safe at eleven oclock danahans telephone rang olgas voice spoke prepare a contract for miss ryan will you

WHILE THE LIGHT LASTS, the ford car bumped from rut to rut and the hot african sun poured down unmercifully on either side of the so called road stretched an unbroken line of trees and scrub rising and falling in gently undulating lines as far as the eye could reach the colouring a soft deep yellow green the whole effect languorous and strangely quiet few birds stirred the slumbering silence once a snake wriggled across the road in front of the car escaping the drivers efforts at destruction with sinuous ease once a native stepped out from the bush dignified and upright behind him a woman with an infant bound closely to her broad back and a complete household equipment including a frying pan balanced magnificently on her head all these things george crozier had not failed to point out to his wife who had answered him with a monosyllabic lack of attention which irritated him thinking of that fellow he deduced wrathfully it was thus that he was wont to allude in his own mind to deirdre croziers first husband killed in the first year of the war killed too in the campaign against german west africa natural she should perhaps he stole a glance at her her fairness the pink and white smoothness of her cheek the rounded lines of her figure rather more rounded perhaps than they had been in those far off days when she had passively permitted him to become engaged to her and then in that first emotional scare of war had abruptly cast him aside and made a war wedding of it with that lean sunburnt boy lover of hers tim nugent well well the fellow was dead gallantly dead and he george crozier had married the girl he had always meant to marry she was fond of him too how could she help it when he was ready to gratify her every wish and had the money to do it too he reflected with some complacency on his last gift to her at kimberley where owing to his friendship with some of the directors of de beers he had been able to purchase a diamond which in the ordinary way would not have been in the market a stone not remarkable as to size but of a very exquisite and rare shade a peculiar deep amber almost old gold a diamond such as you might not find in a hundred years and the look in her eyes when he gave it to her women were all the same about diamonds the necessity of holding on with both hands to prevent himself being jerked out brought george crozier back to the realities he cried out for perhaps the fourteenth time with the pardonable irritation of a man who owns two rolls royce cars and who has exercised his stud on the highways of civilization good lord what a car what a road he went on angrily where the devil is this tobacco estate anyway its over an hour since we left bulawayo lost in rhodesia said deirdre lightly between two involuntary leaps into the air but the coffee coloured driver appealed to responded with the cheering news that their destination was just round the next bend of the road the manager of the estate mr walters was waiting on the stoep to receive them with the touch of deference due to george croziers prominence in union tobacco he introduced his daughter in law who shepherded deirdre through the cool dark inner hall to a bedroom beyond where she could remove the veil with which she was always careful to shield her complexion when motoring as she unfastened the pins in her usual leisurely graceful fashion deirdres eyes swept round the whitewashed ugliness of the bare room no luxuries here and deirdre who loved comfort as a cat loves cream shivered a little on the wall a text confronted her what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul it demanded of all and sundry and deirdre pleasantly conscious that the question had nothing to do with her turned to accompany her shy and rather silent guide she noted but not in the least maliciously the spreading hips and the unbecoming cheap cotton gown and with a glow of quiet appreciation her eyes dropped to the exquisite costly simplicity of her own french white linen beautiful clothes especially when worn by herself roused in her the joy of the artist the two men were waiting for her it wont bore you to come round too mrs crozier not at all ive never been over a tobacco factory they stepped out into the still rhodesian afternoon these are the seedlings here we plant them out as required you see  the managers voice droned on interpolated by her husbands sharp staccato questions output stamp duty problems of coloured labour she ceased to listen this was rhodesia this was the land tim had loved where he and she were to have gone together after the war was over if he had not been killed as always the bitterness of revolt surged up in her at that thought two short months that was all they had had two months of happiness if that mingled rapture and pain were happiness was love ever happiness did not a thousand tortures beset the lovers heart she had lived intensely in that short space but had she ever known the peace the leisure the quiet contentment of her present life and for the first time she admitted somewhat unwillingly that perhaps all had been for the best i wouldnt have liked living out here i mightnt have been able to make tim happy i might have disappointed him george loves me and im very fond of him and hes very very good to me why look at that diamond he bought me only the other day and thinking of it her eyelids dropped a little in pure pleasure this is where we thread the leaves walters led the way into a low long shed on the floor were vast heaps of green leaves and white clad black boys squatted round them picking and rejecting with deft fingers sorting them into sizes and stringing them by means of primitive needles on a long line of string they worked with a cheerful leisureliness jesting amongst themselves and showing their white teeth as they laughed now out here  they passed through the shed into the daylight again where the lines of leaves hung drying in the sun deirdre sniffed delicately at the faint almost imperceptible fragrance that filled the air walters led the way into other sheds where the tobacco kissed by the sun into faint yellow discoloration underwent its further treatment dark here with the brown swinging masses above ready to fall to powder at a rough touch the fragrance was stronger almost overpowering it seemed to deirdre and suddenly a sort of terror came upon her a fear of she knew not what that drove her from that menacing scented obscurity out into the sunlight crozier noted her pallor whats the matter my dear dont you feel well the sun perhaps better not come with us round the plantations eh walters was solicitous mrs crozier had better go back to the house and rest he called to a man a little distance away mr arden mrs crozier mrs croziers feeling a little done up with the heat arden just take her back to the house will you the momentary feeling of dizziness was passing deirdre walked by ardens side she had as yet hardly glanced at him deirdre her heart gave a leap and then stood still only one person had ever spoken her name like that with the faint stress on the first syllable that made of it a caress she turned and stared at the man by her side he was burnt almost black by the sun he walked with a limp and on the cheek nearer hers was a long scar which altered his expression but she knew him tim for an eternity it seemed to her they gazed at each other mute and trembling and then without knowing how or why they were in each others arms time rolled back for them then they drew apart again and deirdre conscious as she put it of the idiocy of the question said then youre not dead no they must have mistaken another chap for me i was badly knocked on the head but i came to and managed to crawl into the bush after that i dont know what happened for months and months but a friendly tribe looked after me and at last i got my proper wits again and managed to get back to civilization he paused i found youd been married six months deirdre cried out oh tim understand please understand it was so awful the loneliness and the poverty i didnt mind being poor with you but when i was alone i hadnt the nerve to stand up against the sordidness of it all its all right deirdre i did understand i know you always have had a hankering after the fleshpots i took you from them once but the second time well my nerve failed i was pretty badly broken up you see could hardly walk without a crutch and then there was this scar she interrupted him passionately do you think i would have cared for that no i know you wouldnt i was a fool some women did mind you know i made up my mind id manage to get a glimpse of you if you looked happy if i thought you were contented to be with crozier why then id remain dead i did see you you were just getting into a big car you had on some lovely sable furs things id never be able to give you if i worked my fingers to the bone and well you seemed happy enough i hadnt the same strength and courage the same belief in myself that id had before the war all i could see was myself broken and useless barely able to earn enough to keep you and you looked so beautiful deirdre such a queen amongst women so worthy to have furs and jewels and lovely clothes and all the hundred and one luxuries crozier could give you that and well the pain of seeing you together decided me everyone believed me dead i would stay dead the pain repeated deirdre in a low voice well damn it all deirdre it hurt it isnt that i blame you i dont but it hurt they were both silent then tim raised her face to his and kissed it with a new tenderness but thats all over now sweetheart the only thing to decide is how were going to break it to crozier oh she drew herself away abruptly i hadnt thought  she broke off as crozier and the manager appeared round the angle of the path with a swift turn of the head she whispered do nothing now leave it to me i must prepare him where could i meet you tomorrow nugent reflected i could come in to bulawayo how about the caf near the standard bank at three oclock it would be pretty empty deirdre gave a brief nod of assent before turning her back on him and joining the other two men tim nugent looked after her with a faint frown something in her manner puzzled him deirdre was very silent during the drive home sheltering behind the fiction of a touch of the sun she deliberated on her course of action how should she tell him how would he take it a strange lassitude seemed to possess her and a growing desire to postpone the revelation as long as might be tomorrow would be soon enough there would be plenty of time before three oclock the hotel was uncomfortable their room was on the ground floor looking out on to an inner court deirdre stood that evening sniffing the stale air and glancing distastefully at the tawdry furniture her mind flew to the easy luxury of monkton court amidst the surrey pinewoods when her maid left her at last she went slowly to her jewel case in the palm of her hand the golden diamond returned her stare with an almost violent gesture she returned it to the case and slammed down the lid tomorrow morning she would tell george she slept badly it was stifling beneath the heavy folds of the mosquito netting the throbbing darkness was punctuated by the ubiquitous ping she had learnt to dread she awoke white and listless impossible to start a scene so early in the day she lay in the small close room all the morning resting lunchtime came upon her with a sense of shock as they sat drinking coffee george crozier proposed a drive to the matopos plenty of time if we start at once deirdre shook her head pleading a headache and she thought to herself that settles it i cant rush the thing after all what does a day more or less matter ill explain to tim she waved goodbye to crozier as he rattled off in the battered ford then glancing at her watch she walked slowly to the meeting place the caf was deserted at this hour they sat down at a little table and ordered the inevitable tea that south africa drinks at all hours of the day and night neither of them said a word till the waitress brought it and withdrew to her fastness behind some pink curtains then deirdre looked up and started as she met the intense watchfulness in his eyes deirdre have you told him she shook her head moistening her lips seeking for words that would not come why not i havent had a chance there hasnt been time even to herself the words sounded halting and unconvincing its not that theres something else i suspected it yesterday im sure of it today deirdre what is it she shook her head dumbly theres some reason why you dont want to leave george crozier why you dont want to come back to me what is it it was true as he said it she knew it knew it with sudden scorching shame but knew it beyond any possibility of doubt and still his eyes searched her it isnt that you love him you dont but theres something she thought in another moment hell see oh god dont let him suddenly his face whitened deirdre is it is it that theres going to be a child in a flash she saw the chance he offered her a wonderful way slowly almost without her own volition she bowed her head she heard his quick breathing then his voice rather high and hard that alters things i didnt know weve got to find a different way out he leant across the table and caught both her hands in his deirdre my darling never think never dream that you were in any way to blame whatever happens remember that i should have claimed you when i came back to england i funked it so its up to me to do what i can to put things straight now you see whatever happens dont fret darling nothing has been your fault he lifted first one hand then the other to his lips then she was alone staring at the untasted tea and strangely enough it was only one thing that she saw a gaudily illuminated text hanging on a whitewashed wall the words seemed to spring out from it and hurl themselves at her what shall it profit a man  she got up paid for her tea and went out on his return george crozier was met by a request that his wife might not be disturbed her headache the maid said was very bad it was nine oclock the next morning when he entered her bedroom his face rather grave deirdre was sitting up in bed she looked white and haggard but her eyes shone george ive got something to tell you something rather terrible  he interrupted her brusquely so youve heard i was afraid it might upset you upset me yes you talked to the poor young fellow that day he saw her hand steal to her heart her eyelids flicker then she said in a low quick voice that somehow frightened him ive heard nothing tell me quickly i thought  tell me out at that tobacco estate chap shot himself badly broken up in the war nerves all to pieces i suppose theres no other reason to account for it he shot himself in that dark shed where the tobacco was hanging she spoke with certainty her eyes like a sleepwalkers as she saw before her in the odorous darkness a figure lying there revolver in hand why to be sure thats where you were taken queer yesterday odd thing that deirdre did not answer she saw another picture a table with tea things on it and a woman bowing her head in acceptance of a lie well well the war has a lot to answer for said crozier and stretched out his hand for a match lighting his pipe with careful puffs his wifes cry startled him ah dont dont i cant bear the smell he stared at her in kindly astonishment my dear girl you mustnt be nervy after all you cant escape from the smell of tobacco youll meet it everywhere yes everywhere she smiled a slow twisted smile and murmured some words that he did not catch words that she had chosen for the original obituary notice of tim nugents death while the light lasts i shall remember and in the darkness i shall not forget her eyes widened as they followed the ascending spiral of smoke and she repeated in a low monotonous voice everywhere everywhere four ,1924,213,3819,3024,85.58378772635817,14.19718309859155,1.2628968253968254, the ford car bumped from rut to rut and the hot african sun poured down unmercifully on either side of the so called road stretched an unbroken line of trees and scrub rising and falling in gently undulating lines as far as the eye could reach the colouring a soft deep yellow green the whole effect languorous and strangely quiet few birds stirred the slumbering silence once a snake wriggled across the road in front of the car escaping the drivers efforts at destruction with sinuous ease once a native stepped out from the bush dignified and upright behind him a woman with an infant bound closely to her broad back and a complete household equipment including a frying pan balanced magnificently on her head all these things george crozier had not failed to point out to his wife who had answered him with a monosyllabic lack of attention which irritated him thinking of that fellow he deduced wrathfully it was thus that he was wont to allude in his own mind to deirdre croziers first husband killed in the first year of the war killed too in the campaign against german west africa natural she should perhaps he stole a glance at her her fairness the pink and white smoothness of her cheek the rounded lines of her figure rather more rounded perhaps than they had been in those far off days when she had passively permitted him to become engaged to her and then in that first emotional scare of war had abruptly cast him aside and made a war wedding of it with that lean sunburnt boy lover of hers tim nugent well well the fellow was dead gallantly dead and he george crozier had married the girl he had always meant to marry she was fond of him too how could she help it when he was ready to gratify her every wish and had the money to do it too he reflected with some complacency on his last gift to her at kimberley where owing to his friendship with some of the directors of de beers he had been able to purchase a diamond which in the ordinary way would not have been in the market a stone not remarkable as to size but of a very exquisite and rare shade a peculiar deep amber almost old gold a diamond such as you might not find in a hundred years and the look in her eyes when he gave it to her women were all the same about diamonds the necessity of holding on with both hands to prevent himself being jerked out brought george crozier back to the realities he cried out for perhaps the fourteenth time with the pardonable irritation of a man who owns two rolls royce cars and who has exercised his stud on the highways of civilization good lord what a car what a road he went on angrily where the devil is this tobacco estate anyway its over an hour since we left bulawayo lost in rhodesia said deirdre lightly between two involuntary leaps into the air but the coffee coloured driver appealed to responded with the cheering news that their destination was just round the next bend of the road the manager of the estate mr walters was waiting on the stoep to receive them with the touch of deference due to george croziers prominence in union tobacco he introduced his daughter in law who shepherded deirdre through the cool dark inner hall to a bedroom beyond where she could remove the veil with which she was always careful to shield her complexion when motoring as she unfastened the pins in her usual leisurely graceful fashion deirdres eyes swept round the whitewashed ugliness of the bare room no luxuries here and deirdre who loved comfort as a cat loves cream shivered a little on the wall a text confronted her what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul it demanded of all and sundry and deirdre pleasantly conscious that the question had nothing to do with her turned to accompany her shy and rather silent guide she noted but not in the least maliciously the spreading hips and the unbecoming cheap cotton gown and with a glow of quiet appreciation her eyes dropped to the exquisite costly simplicity of her own french white linen beautiful clothes especially when worn by herself roused in her the joy of the artist the two men were waiting for her it wont bore you to come round too mrs crozier not at all ive never been over a tobacco factory they stepped out into the still rhodesian afternoon these are the seedlings here we plant them out as required you see  the managers voice droned on interpolated by her husbands sharp staccato questions output stamp duty problems of coloured labour she ceased to listen this was rhodesia this was the land tim had loved where he and she were to have gone together after the war was over if he had not been killed as always the bitterness of revolt surged up in her at that thought two short months that was all they had had two months of happiness if that mingled rapture and pain were happiness was love ever happiness did not a thousand tortures beset the lovers heart she had lived intensely in that short space but had she ever known the peace the leisure the quiet contentment of her present life and for the first time she admitted somewhat unwillingly that perhaps all had been for the best i wouldnt have liked living out here i mightnt have been able to make tim happy i might have disappointed him george loves me and im very fond of him and hes very very good to me why look at that diamond he bought me only the other day and thinking of it her eyelids dropped a little in pure pleasure this is where we thread the leaves walters led the way into a low long shed on the floor were vast heaps of green leaves and white clad black boys squatted round them picking and rejecting with deft fingers sorting them into sizes and stringing them by means of primitive needles on a long line of string they worked with a cheerful leisureliness jesting amongst themselves and showing their white teeth as they laughed now out here  they passed through the shed into the daylight again where the lines of leaves hung drying in the sun deirdre sniffed delicately at the faint almost imperceptible fragrance that filled the air walters led the way into other sheds where the tobacco kissed by the sun into faint yellow discoloration underwent its further treatment dark here with the brown swinging masses above ready to fall to powder at a rough touch the fragrance was stronger almost overpowering it seemed to deirdre and suddenly a sort of terror came upon her a fear of she knew not what that drove her from that menacing scented obscurity out into the sunlight crozier noted her pallor whats the matter my dear dont you feel well the sun perhaps better not come with us round the plantations eh walters was solicitous mrs crozier had better go back to the house and rest he called to a man a little distance away mr arden mrs crozier mrs croziers feeling a little done up with the heat arden just take her back to the house will you the momentary feeling of dizziness was passing deirdre walked by ardens side she had as yet hardly glanced at him deirdre her heart gave a leap and then stood still only one person had ever spoken her name like that with the faint stress on the first syllable that made of it a caress she turned and stared at the man by her side he was burnt almost black by the sun he walked with a limp and on the cheek nearer hers was a long scar which altered his expression but she knew him tim for an eternity it seemed to her they gazed at each other mute and trembling and then without knowing how or why they were in each others arms time rolled back for them then they drew apart again and deirdre conscious as she put it of the idiocy of the question said then youre not dead no they must have mistaken another chap for me i was badly knocked on the head but i came to and managed to crawl into the bush after that i dont know what happened for months and months but a friendly tribe looked after me and at last i got my proper wits again and managed to get back to civilization he paused i found youd been married six months deirdre cried out oh tim understand please understand it was so awful the loneliness and the poverty i didnt mind being poor with you but when i was alone i hadnt the nerve to stand up against the sordidness of it all its all right deirdre i did understand i know you always have had a hankering after the fleshpots i took you from them once but the second time well my nerve failed i was pretty badly broken up you see could hardly walk without a crutch and then there was this scar she interrupted him passionately do you think i would have cared for that no i know you wouldnt i was a fool some women did mind you know i made up my mind id manage to get a glimpse of you if you looked happy if i thought you were contented to be with crozier why then id remain dead i did see you you were just getting into a big car you had on some lovely sable furs things id never be able to give you if i worked my fingers to the bone and well you seemed happy enough i hadnt the same strength and courage the same belief in myself that id had before the war all i could see was myself broken and useless barely able to earn enough to keep you and you looked so beautiful deirdre such a queen amongst women so worthy to have furs and jewels and lovely clothes and all the hundred and one luxuries crozier could give you that and well the pain of seeing you together decided me everyone believed me dead i would stay dead the pain repeated deirdre in a low voice well damn it all deirdre it hurt it isnt that i blame you i dont but it hurt they were both silent then tim raised her face to his and kissed it with a new tenderness but thats all over now sweetheart the only thing to decide is how were going to break it to crozier oh she drew herself away abruptly i hadnt thought  she broke off as crozier and the manager appeared round the angle of the path with a swift turn of the head she whispered do nothing now leave it to me i must prepare him where could i meet you tomorrow nugent reflected i could come in to bulawayo how about the caf near the standard bank at three oclock it would be pretty empty deirdre gave a brief nod of assent before turning her back on him and joining the other two men tim nugent looked after her with a faint frown something in her manner puzzled him deirdre was very silent during the drive home sheltering behind the fiction of a touch of the sun she deliberated on her course of action how should she tell him how would he take it a strange lassitude seemed to possess her and a growing desire to postpone the revelation as long as might be tomorrow would be soon enough there would be plenty of time before three oclock the hotel was uncomfortable their room was on the ground floor looking out on to an inner court deirdre stood that evening sniffing the stale air and glancing distastefully at the tawdry furniture her mind flew to the easy luxury of monkton court amidst the surrey pinewoods when her maid left her at last she went slowly to her jewel case in the palm of her hand the golden diamond returned her stare with an almost violent gesture she returned it to the case and slammed down the lid tomorrow morning she would tell george she slept badly it was stifling beneath the heavy folds of the mosquito netting the throbbing darkness was punctuated by the ubiquitous ping she had learnt to dread she awoke white and listless impossible to start a scene so early in the day she lay in the small close room all the morning resting lunchtime came upon her with a sense of shock as they sat drinking coffee george crozier proposed a drive to the matopos plenty of time if we start at once deirdre shook her head pleading a headache and she thought to herself that settles it i cant rush the thing after all what does a day more or less matter ill explain to tim she waved goodbye to crozier as he rattled off in the battered ford then glancing at her watch she walked slowly to the meeting place the caf was deserted at this hour they sat down at a little table and ordered the inevitable tea that south africa drinks at all hours of the day and night neither of them said a word till the waitress brought it and withdrew to her fastness behind some pink curtains then deirdre looked up and started as she met the intense watchfulness in his eyes deirdre have you told him she shook her head moistening her lips seeking for words that would not come why not i havent had a chance there hasnt been time even to herself the words sounded halting and unconvincing its not that theres something else i suspected it yesterday im sure of it today deirdre what is it she shook her head dumbly theres some reason why you dont want to leave george crozier why you dont want to come back to me what is it it was true as he said it she knew it knew it with sudden scorching shame but knew it beyond any possibility of doubt and still his eyes searched her it isnt that you love him you dont but theres something she thought in another moment hell see oh god dont let him suddenly his face whitened deirdre is it is it that theres going to be a child in a flash she saw the chance he offered her a wonderful way slowly almost without her own volition she bowed her head she heard his quick breathing then his voice rather high and hard that alters things i didnt know weve got to find a different way out he leant across the table and caught both her hands in his deirdre my darling never think never dream that you were in any way to blame whatever happens remember that i should have claimed you when i came back to england i funked it so its up to me to do what i can to put things straight now you see whatever happens dont fret darling nothing has been your fault he lifted first one hand then the other to his lips then she was alone staring at the untasted tea and strangely enough it was only one thing that she saw a gaudily illuminated text hanging on a whitewashed wall the words seemed to spring out from it and hurl themselves at her what shall it profit a man  she got up paid for her tea and went out on his return george crozier was met by a request that his wife might not be disturbed her headache the maid said was very bad it was nine oclock the next morning when he entered her bedroom his face rather grave deirdre was sitting up in bed she looked white and haggard but her eyes shone george ive got something to tell you something rather terrible  he interrupted her brusquely so youve heard i was afraid it might upset you upset me yes you talked to the poor young fellow that day he saw her hand steal to her heart her eyelids flicker then she said in a low quick voice that somehow frightened him ive heard nothing tell me quickly i thought  tell me out at that tobacco estate chap shot himself badly broken up in the war nerves all to pieces i suppose theres no other reason to account for it he shot himself in that dark shed where the tobacco was hanging she spoke with certainty her eyes like a sleepwalkers as she saw before her in the odorous darkness a figure lying there revolver in hand why to be sure thats where you were taken queer yesterday odd thing that deirdre did not answer she saw another picture a table with tea things on it and a woman bowing her head in acceptance of a lie well well the war has a lot to answer for said crozier and stretched out his hand for a match lighting his pipe with careful puffs his wifes cry startled him ah dont dont i cant bear the smell he stared at her in kindly astonishment my dear girl you mustnt be nervy after all you cant escape from the smell of tobacco youll meet it everywhere yes everywhere she smiled a slow twisted smile and murmured some words that he did not catch words that she had chosen for the original obituary notice of tim nugents death while the light lasts i shall remember and in the darkness i shall not forget her eyes widened as they followed the ascending spiral of smoke and she repeated in a low monotonous voice everywhere everywhere four

THE HOUSE OF DREAMS, according to agatha christies autobiography it was a revised version of the unpublished the house of beauty written before the first world war and the first thing i ever wrote that showed any kind of promise this is the story of john segrave of his life which was unsatisfactory of his love which was unsatisfied of his dreams and of his death and if in the two latter he found what was denied in the two former then his life may after all be taken as a success who knows john segrave came of a family which had been slowly going downhill for the last century they had been landowners since the days of elizabeth but their last piece of property was sold it was thought well that one of the sons at least should acquire the useful art of moneymaking it was an unconscious irony of fate that john should be the one chosen with his strangely sensitive mouth and the long dark blue slits of eyes that suggested an elf or a faun something wild and of the woods it was incongruous that he should be offered up a sacrifice on the altar of finance the smell of the earth the taste of the sea salt on ones lips and the free sky above ones head these were the things beloved by john segrave to which he was to bid farewell at the age of eighteen he became a junior clerk in a big business house seven years later he was still a clerk not quite so junior but with status otherwise unchanged the faculty for getting on in the world had been omitted from his makeup he was punctual industrious plodding a clerk and nothing but a clerk and yet he might have been what he could hardly answer that question himself but he could not rid himself of the conviction that somewhere there was a life in which he could have counted there was power in him swiftness of vision a something of which his fellow toilers had never had a glimpse they liked him he was popular because of his air of careless friendship and they never appreciated the fact that he barred them but by that same manner from any real intimacy the dream came to him suddenly it was no childish fantasy growing and developing through the years it came on a midsummer night or rather early morning and he woke from it tingling all over striving to hold it to him as it fled slipping from his clutch in the elusive way dreams have desperately he clung to it it must not go it must not he must remember the house it was the house of course the house he knew so well was it a real house or did he merely know it in dreams he didnt remember but he certainly knew it knew it very well the faint grey light of the early morning was stealing into the room the stillness was extraordinary at four thirty am london weary london found her brief instant of peace john segrave lay quiet wrapped in the joy the exquisite wonder and beauty of his dream how clever it had been of him to remember it a dream flitted so quickly as a rule ran past you just as with waking consciousness your clumsy fingers sought to stop and hold it but he had been too quick for this dream he had seized it as it was slipping swiftly by him it was really a most remarkable dream there was the house and his thoughts were brought up with a jerk for when he came to think of it he couldnt remember anything but the house and suddenly with a tinge of disappointment he recognized that after all the house was quite strange to him he hadnt even dreamed of it before it was a white house standing on high ground there were trees near it blue hills in the distance but its peculiar charm was independent of surroundings for and this was the point the climax of the dream it was a beautiful a strangely beautiful house his pulses quickened as he remembered anew the strange beauty of the house the outside of it of course for he hadnt been inside there had been no question of that no question of it whatsoever then as the dingy outlines of his bed sitting room began to take shape in the growing light he experienced the disillusion of the dreamer perhaps after all his dream hadnt been so very wonderful or had the wonderful the explanatory part slipped past him and laughed at his ineffectual clutching hands a white house standing on high ground there wasnt much there to get excited about surely it was rather a big house he remembered with a lot of windows in it and the blinds were all down not because the people were away he was sure of that but because it was so early that no one was up yet then he laughed at the absurdity of his imaginings and remembered that he was to dine with mr wetterman that night maisie wetterman was rudolf wettermans only daughter and she had been accustomed all her life to having exactly what she wanted paying a visit to her fathers office one day she had noticed john segrave he had brought

particular enthusiasm he couldnt imagine why the old boy had asked him if he could have got out of it he would have done so the house depressed him with its solid magnificence and the soft pile of its carpet a girl came forward and shook hands with him he remembered vaguely having seen her one day in her fathers office how do you do mr segrave mr segrave miss kerr then he woke who was she where did she come from from the flame coloured draperies that floated round her to the tiny mercury wings on her small greek head she was a being transitory and fugitive standing out against the dull background with an effect of unreality rudolf wetterman came in his broad expanse of gleaming shirt front creaking as he walked they went down informally to dinner allegra kerr talked to her host john segrave had to devote himself to maisie but his whole mind was on the girl on the other side of him she was marvellously effective her effectiveness was he thought more studied than natural but behind all that there lay something else flickering fire fitful capricious like the will o the wisps that of old lured men into the marshes at last he got a chance to speak to her maisie was giving her father a message from some friend she had met that day now that the moment had come he was tongue tied his glance pleaded with her dumbly dinner table topics she said lightly shall we start with the theatres or with one of those innumerable openings beginning do you like   john laughed and if we find we both like dogs and dislike sandy cats it will form what is called a bond between us assuredly said allegra gravely it is i think a pity to begin with a catechism yet it puts conversation within the reach of all true but with disastrous results it is useful to know the rules if only to break them john smiled at her i take it then that you and i will indulge our personal vagaries even though we display thereby the genius that is akin to madness with a sharp unguarded movement the girls hand swept a wineglass off the table there was the tinkle of broken glass maisie and her father stopped speaking im so sorry mr wetterman im throwing glasses on the floor my dear allegra it doesnt matter at all not at all beneath his breath john segrave said quickly broken glass thats bad luck i wish it hadnt happened dont worry how does it go ill luck thou canst not bring where ill luck has its home  she turned once more to wetterman john resuming conversation with maisie tried to place the quotation he got it at last they were the words used by sieglinde in the walkre when sigmund offers to leave the house he thought did she mean  but maisie was asking his opinion of the latest revue soon he had admitted that he was fond of music after dinner said maisie well make allegra play for us they all went up to the drawing room together secretly wetterman considered it a barbarous custom he liked the ponderous gravity of the wine passing round the handed cigars but perhaps it was as well tonight he didnt know what on earth he could find to say to young segrave maisie was too bad with her whims it wasnt as though the fellow were good looking really good looking and certainly he wasnt amusing he was glad when maisie asked allegra kerr to play theyd get through the evening sooner the young idiot didnt even play bridge allegra played well though without the sure touch of a professional she played modern music debussy and strauss a little scriabin then she dropped into the first movement of beethovens pathtique that expression of a grief that is infinite a sorrow that is endless and vast as the ages but in which from end to end breathes the spirit that will not accept defeat in the solemnity of undying woe it moves with the rhythm of the conqueror to its final doom towards the end she faltered her fingers struck a discord and she broke off abruptly she looked across at maisie and laughed mockingly you see she said they wont let me then without waiting for a reply to her somewhat enigmatical remark she plunged into a strange haunting melody a thing of weird harmonies and curious measured rhythm quite unlike anything segrave had ever heard before it was delicate as the flight of a bird poised hovering suddenly without the least warning it turned into a mere discordant jangle of notes and allegra rose laughing from the piano in spite of her laugh she looked disturbed and almost frightened she sat down by maisie and john heard the latter say in a low tone to her you shouldnt do it you really shouldnt do it what was the last thing john asked eagerly something of my own she spoke sharply and curtly wetterman changed the subject that night john segrave dreamt again of the house john was unhappy his life was irksome to him as never before up to now he had accepted it patiently a disagreeable necessity but one which left his inner freedom essentially untouched now all that was changed the outer world and the inner intermingled he did not disguise to himself the reason for the change he had fallen in love at first sight with allegra kerr what was he going to do about it he had been too bewildered that first night to make any plans he had not even tried to see her again a little later when maisie wetterman asked him down to her fathers place in the country for a weekend he went eagerly but he was disappointed for allegra was not there he mentioned her once tentatively to maisie and she told him that allegra was up in scotland paying a visit he left it at that he would have liked to go on talking about her but the words seemed to stick in his throat maisie was puzzled by him that weekend he didnt appear to see well to see what was so plainly to be seen she was a direct young woman in her methods but directness was lost upon john he thought her kind but a little overpowering yet the fates were stronger than maisie they willed that john should see allegra again they met in the park one sunday afternoon he had seen her from far off and his heart thumped against the side of his ribs supposing she should have forgotten him  but she had not forgotten she stopped and spoke in a few minutes they were walking side by side striking out across the grass he was ridiculously happy he said suddenly and unexpectedly do you believe in dreams i believe in nightmares the harshness of her voice startled him nightmares he said stupidly i didnt mean nightmares allegra looked at him no she said there have been no nightmares in your life i can see that her voice was gentle different he told her then of his dream of the white house stammering a little he had had it now six no seven times always the same it was beautiful so beautiful he went on you see its to do with you in some way i had it first the night before i met you to do with me she laughed a short bitter laugh oh no thats impossible the house was beautiful so are you said john segrave allegra flushed a little with annoyance im sorry i was stupid i seemed to ask for a compliment didnt i but i didnt really mean that at all the outside of me is all right i know i havent seen the inside of the house yet said john segrave when i do i know it will be quite as beautiful as the outside he spoke slowly and gravely giving the words a meaning that she chose to ignore there is something more i want to tell you if you will listen i will listen said allegra i am chucking up this job of mine i ought to have done it long ago i see that now i have been content to drift along knowing i was an utter failure without caring much just living from day to day a man shouldnt do that its a mans business to find something he can do and make a success of it im chucking this and taking on something else quite a different sort of thing its a kind of expedition in west africa i cant tell you the details theyre not supposed to be known but if it comes off well i shall be a rich man so you too count success in terms of money money said john segrave means just one thing to me you when i come back  he paused she bent her head her face had grown very pale i wont pretend to misunderstand thats why i must tell you now once and for all i shall never marry he stayed a little while considering then he said very gently cant you tell me why i could but more than anything in the world i do not want to tell you again he was silent then he looked up suddenly and a singularly attractive smile illumined his fauns face i see he said so you wont let me come inside the house not even to peep in for a second the blinds are to stay down allegra leaned forward and laid her hand on his i will tell you this much you dream of your house but i dont dream my dreams are nightmares and on that she left him abruptly disconcertingly that night once more he dreamed of late he had realized that the house was most certainly tenanted he had seen a hand draw aside the blinds had caught glimpses of moving figures within tonight the house seemed fairer than it had ever done before its white walls shone in the sunlight the peace and the beauty of it were complete then suddenly he became aware of a fuller ripple of the waves of joy someone was coming to the window he knew it a hand the same hand that he had seen before laid hold of the blind drawing it back in a minute he would see    he was awake still quivering with the horror the unutterable loathing of the thing that had looked out at him from the window of the house it was a thing utterly and wholly horrible a thing so vile and loathsome that the mere remembrance of it made him feel sick and he knew that the most unutterably and horribly vile thing about it was its presence in that house the house of beauty for where that thing abode was horror horror that rose up and slew the peace and the serenity which were the birthright of the house the beauty the wonderful immortal beauty of the house was destroyed for ever for within its holy consecrated walls there dwelt the shadow of an unclean thing if ever again he should dream of the house segrave knew he would awake at once with a start of terror lest from its white beauty that thing might suddenly look out at him the following evening when he left the office he went straight to the wettermans house he must see allegra kerr maisie would tell him where she was to be found he never noticed the eager light that flashed into maisies eyes as he was shown in and she jumped up to greet him he stammered out his request at once with her hand still in his miss kerr i met her yesterday but i dont know where shes staying he did not feel maisies hand grow limp in his as she withdrew it the sudden coldness of her voice told him nothing allegra is here staying with us but im afraid you cant see her but  you see her mother died this morning weve just had the news oh he was taken aback it is all very sad said maisie she hesitated just a minute then went on you see she died in well practically an asylum theres insanity in the family the grandfather shot himself and one of allegras aunts is a hopeless imbecile and another drowned herself john segrave made an inarticulate sound i thought i ought to tell you said maisie virtuously were such friends arent we and of course allegra is very attractive lots of people have asked her to marry them but naturally she wont marry at all she couldnt could she shes all right said segrave theres nothing wrong with her his voice sounded hoarse and unnatural in his own ears one never knows her mother was quite all right when she was young and she wasnt just peculiar you know she was quite raving mad its a dreadful thing insanity yes he said its a most awful thing he knew now what it was that had looked at him from the window of the house maisie was still talking on he interrupted her brusquely i really came to say goodbye and to thank you for all your kindness youre not going away there was alarm in her voice he smiled sideways at her a crooked smile pathetic and attractive yes he said to africa africa maisie echoed the word blankly before she could pull herself together he had shaken her by the hand and gone she was left standing there her hands clenched by her sides an angry spot of colour in each cheek below on the doorstep john segrave came face to face with allegra coming in from the street she was in black her face white and lifeless she took one glance at him then drew him into a small morning room maisie told you she said you know he nodded but what does it matter youre all right it it leaves some people out she looked at him sombrely mournfully you are all right he repeated i dont know she almost whispered it i dont know i told you about my dreams and when i play when im at the piano those others come and take hold of my hands he was staring at her paralysed for one instant as she spoke something looked out from her eyes it was gone in a flash but he knew it it was the thing that had looked out from the house she caught his momentary recoil you see she whispered you see but i wish maisie hadnt told you it takes everything from you everything yes there wont even be the dreams left for now youll never dare to dream of the house again the west african sun poured down and the heat was intense john segrave continued to moan i cant find it i cant find it the little english doctor with the red head and the tremendous jaw scowled down upon his patient in that bullying manner which he had made his own hes always saying that what does he mean he speaks i think of a house monsieur the soft voiced sister of charity from the roman catholic mission spoke with her gentle detachment as she too looked down on the stricken man a house eh well hes got to get it out of his head or we shant pull him through its on his mind segrave segrave the wandering attention was fixed the eyes rested with recognition on the doctors face look here youre going to pull through im going to pull you through but youve got to stop worrying about this house it cant run away you know so dont bother about looking for it now all right he seemed obedient i suppose it cant very well run away if its never been there at all of course not the doctor laughed his cheery laugh now youll be all right in no time and with a boisterous bluntness of manner he took his departure segrave lay thinking the fever had abated for the moment and he could think clearly and lucidly he must find that house for ten years he had dreaded finding it the thought that he might come upon it unawares had been his greatest terror and then he remembered when his fears were quite lulled to rest one day it had found him he recalled clearly his first haunting terror and then his sudden his exquisite relief for after all the house was empty quite empty and exquisitely peaceful it was as he remembered it ten years before he had not forgotten there was a huge black furniture van moving slowly away from the house the last tenant of course moving out with his goods he went up to the men in charge of the van and spoke to them there was something rather sinister about that van it was so very black the horses were black too with freely flowing manes and tails and the men all wore black clothes and gloves it all reminded him of something else something that he couldnt remember yes he had been quite right the last tenant was moving out as his lease was up the house was to stand empty for the present until the owner came back from abroad and waking he had been full of the peaceful beauty of the empty house a month after that he had received a letter from maisie she wrote to him perseveringly once a month in it she told him that allegra kerr had died in the same home as her mother and wasnt it dreadfully sad though of course a merciful release it had really been very odd indeed coming after his dream like that he didnt quite understand it all but it was odd and the worst of it was that hed never been able to find the house since somehow hed forgotten the way the fever began to take hold of him once more he tossed restlessly of course hed forgotten the house was on high ground he must climb to get there but it was hot work climbing cliffs dreadfully hot up up up oh he had slipped he must start again from the bottom up up up days passed weeks he wasnt sure that years didnt go by and he was still climbing once he heard the doctors voice but he couldnt stop climbing to listen besides the doctor would tell him to leave off looking for the house he thought it was an ordinary house he didnt know he remembered suddenly that he must be calm very calm you couldnt find the house unless you were very calm it was no use looking for the house in a hurry or being excited if he could only keep calm but it was so hot hot it was cold yes cold these werent cliffs they were icebergs jagged cold icebergs he was so tired he wouldnt go on looking it was no good ah here was a lane that was better than icebergs anyway how pleasant and shady it was in the cool green lane and those trees they were splendid they were rather like what he couldnt remember but it didnt matter ah here were flowers all golden and blue how lovely it all was and how strangely familiar of course he had been here before there through the trees was the gleam of the house standing on the high ground how beautiful it was the green lane and the trees and the flowers were as nothing to the paramount the all satisfying beauty of the house he hastened his steps to think that he had never yet been inside how unbelievably stupid of him when he had the key in his pocket all the time and of course the beauty of the exterior was as nothing to the beauty that lay within especially now that the owner had come back from abroad he mounted the steps to the great door cruel strong hands were dragging him back they fought him dragging him to and fro backwards and forwards the doctor was shaking him roaring in his ear hold on man you can dont let go dont let go his eyes were alight with the fierceness of one who sees an enemy segrave wondered who the enemy was the black robed nun was praying that too was strange and all he wanted was to be left alone to go back to the house for every minute the house was growing fainter that of course was because the doctor was so strong he wasnt strong enough to fight the doctor if he only could but stop there was another way the way dreams went in the moment of waking no strength could stop them they just flitted past the doctors hands wouldnt be able to hold him if he slipped just slipped yes that was the way the white walls were visible once more the doctors voice was fainter his hands were barely felt he knew now how dreams laugh when they give you the slip he was at the door of the house the exquisite stillness was unbroken he put the key in the lock and turned it just a moment he waited to realize to the full the perfect the ineffable the all satisfying completeness of joy then he passed over the threshold

before the first world war and the first thing i ever wrote that showed any kind of promise this is the story of john segrave of his life which was unsatisfactory of his love which was unsatisfied of his dreams and of his death and if in the two latter he found what was denied in the two former then his life may after all be taken as a success who knows john segrave came of a family which had been slowly going downhill for the last century they had been landowners since the days of elizabeth but their last piece of property was sold it was thought well that one of the sons at least should acquire the useful art of moneymaking it was an unconscious irony of fate that john should be the one chosen with his strangely sensitive mouth and the long dark blue slits of eyes that suggested an elf or a faun something wild and of the woods it was incongruous that he should be offered up a sacrifice on the altar of finance the smell of the earth the taste of the sea salt on ones lips and the free sky above ones head these were the things beloved by john segrave to which he was to bid farewell at the age of eighteen he became a junior clerk in a big business house seven years later he was still a clerk not quite so junior but with status otherwise unchanged the faculty for getting on in the world had been omitted from his makeup he was punctual industrious plodding a clerk and nothing but a clerk and yet he might have been what he could hardly answer that question himself but he could not rid himself of the conviction that somewhere there was a life in which he could have counted there was power in him swiftness of vision a something of which his fellow toilers had never had a glimpse they liked him he was popular because of his air of careless friendship and they never appreciated the fact that he barred them but by that same manner from any real intimacy the dream came to him suddenly it was no childish fantasy growing and developing through the years it came on a midsummer night or rather early morning and he woke from it tingling all over striving to hold it to him as it fled slipping from his clutch in the elusive way dreams have desperately he clung to it it must not go it must not he must remember the house it was the house of course the house he knew so well was it a real house or did he merely know it in dreams he didnt remember but he certainly knew it knew it very well the faint grey light of the early morning was stealing into the room the stillness was extraordinary at four thirty am london weary london found her brief instant of peace john segrave lay quiet wrapped in the joy the exquisite wonder and beauty of his dream how clever it had been of him to remember it a dream flitted so quickly as a rule ran past you just as with waking consciousness your clumsy fingers sought to stop and hold it but he had been too quick for this dream he had seized it as it was slipping swiftly by him it was really a most remarkable dream there was the house and his thoughts were brought up with a jerk for when he came to think of it he couldnt remember anything but the house and suddenly with a tinge of disappointment he recognized that after all the house was quite strange to him he hadnt even dreamed of it before it was a white house standing on high ground there were trees near it blue hills in the distance but its peculiar charm was independent of surroundings for and this was the point the climax of the dream it was a beautiful a strangely beautiful house his pulses quickened as he remembered anew the strange beauty of the house the outside of it of course for he hadnt been inside there had been no question of that no question of it whatsoever then as the dingy outlines of his bed sitting room began to take shape in the growing light he experienced the disillusion of the dreamer perhaps after all his dream hadnt been so very wonderful or had the wonderful the explanatory part slipped past him and laughed at his ineffectual clutching hands a white house standing on high ground there wasnt much there to get excited about surely it was rather a big house he remembered with a lot of windows in it and the blinds were all down not because the people were away he was sure of that but because it was so early that no one was up yet then he laughed at the absurdity of his imaginings and remembered that he was to dine with mr wetterman that night maisie wetterman was rudolf wettermans only daughter and she had been accustomed all her life to having exactly what she wanted paying a visit to her fathers office one day she had noticed john segrave he had brought in some letters that her father had asked for when he had departed again she asked her father about him wetterman was communicative one of sir edward segraves sons fine old family but on its last legs this boy will never set the thames on fire i like him all right but theres nothing to him no punch of any kind maisie was perhaps indifferent

segrave and a girlfriend who was staying with her the girlfriend was moved to make a few remarks on approval i suppose maisie later father will do it up in a nice little parcel and bring it home from

night to make any plans he had not even tried to see her again a little later when maisie wetterman asked him down to her fathers place in the country for a weekend he went eagerly but he was disappointed for allegra was not there he mentioned her once tentatively to maisie and she told him that allegra was up in scotland paying a visit he left it at that he would have liked to go on talking about her but the words seemed to stick in his throat maisie was puzzled by him that weekend he didnt appear to see well to see what was so plainly to be seen she was a direct young woman in her methods but directness was lost upon john he thought her kind but a little overpowering yet the fates were stronger than maisie they willed that john should see allegra again they met in the park one sunday afternoon he had seen her from far off and his heart thumped against the side of his ribs supposing she should have forgotten him  but she had not forgotten she stopped and spoke in a few minutes they were walking side by side striking out across the grass he was ridiculously happy he said suddenly and unexpectedly do you believe in dreams i believe in nightmares the harshness of her voice startled him nightmares he said stupidly i didnt mean nightmares allegra looked at him no she said there have been no nightmares in your life i can see that her voice was gentle different he told her then of his dream of the white house stammering a little he had had it now six no seven times always the same it was beautiful so beautiful he went on you see its to do with you in some way i had it first the night before i met you to do with me she laughed a short bitter laugh oh no thats impossible the house was beautiful so are you said john segrave allegra flushed a little with annoyance im sorry i was stupid i seemed to ask for a compliment didnt i but i didnt really mean that at all the outside of me is all right i know i havent seen the inside of the house yet said john segrave when i do i know it will be quite as beautiful as the outside he spoke slowly and gravely giving the words a meaning that she chose to ignore there is something more i want to tell you if you will listen i will listen said allegra i am chucking up this job of mine i ought to have done it long ago i see that now i have been content to drift along knowing i was an utter failure without caring much just living from day to day a man shouldnt do that its a mans business to find something he can do and make a success of it im chucking this and taking on something else quite a different sort of thing its a kind of expedition in west africa i cant tell you the details theyre not supposed to be known but if it comes off well i shall be a rich man so you too count success in terms of money money said john segrave means just one thing to me you when i come back  he paused she bent her head her face had grown very pale i wont pretend to misunderstand thats why i must tell you now once and for all i shall never marry he stayed a little while considering then he said very gently cant you tell me why i could but more than anything in the world i do not want to tell you again he was silent then he looked up suddenly and a singularly attractive smile illumined his fauns face i see he said so you wont let me come inside the house not even to peep in for a second the blinds are to stay down allegra leaned forward and laid her hand on his i will tell you this much you dream of your house but i dont dream my dreams are nightmares and on that she left him abruptly disconcertingly that night once more he dreamed of late he had realized that the house was most certainly tenanted he had seen a hand draw aside the blinds had caught glimpses of moving figures within tonight the house seemed fairer than it had ever done before its white walls shone in the sunlight the peace and the beauty of it were complete then suddenly he became aware of a fuller ripple of the waves of joy someone was coming to the window he knew it a hand the same hand that he had seen before laid hold of the blind drawing it back in a minute he would see    he was awake still quivering with the horror the unutterable loathing of the thing that had looked out at him from the window of the house it was a thing utterly and wholly horrible a thing so vile and loathsome that the mere remembrance of it made him feel sick and he knew that the most unutterably and horribly vile thing about it was its presence in that house the house of beauty for where that thing abode was horror horror that rose up and slew the peace and the serenity which were the birthright of the house the beauty the wonderful immortal beauty of the house was destroyed for ever for within its holy consecrated walls there dwelt the shadow of an unclean thing if ever again he should dream of the house segrave knew he would awake at once with a start of terror lest from its white beauty that thing might suddenly look out at him the following evening when he left the office he went straight to the wettermans house he must see allegra kerr maisie would tell him where she was to be found he never noticed the eager light that flashed into maisies eyes as he was shown in and she jumped up to greet him he stammered out his request at once with her hand still in his miss kerr i met her yesterday but i dont know where shes staying he did not feel maisies hand grow limp in his as she withdrew it the sudden coldness of her voice told him nothing allegra is here staying with us but im afraid you cant see her but  you see her mother died this morning weve just had the news oh he was taken aback it is all very sad said maisie she hesitated just a minute then went on you see she died in well practically an asylum theres insanity in the family the grandfather shot himself and one of allegras aunts is a hopeless imbecile and another drowned herself john segrave made an inarticulate sound i thought i ought to tell you said maisie virtuously were such friends arent we and of course allegra is very attractive lots of people have asked her to marry them but naturally she wont marry at all she couldnt could she shes all right said segrave theres nothing wrong with her his voice sounded hoarse and unnatural in his own ears one never knows her mother was quite all right when she was young and she wasnt just peculiar you know she was quite raving mad its a dreadful thing insanity yes he said its a most awful thing he knew now what it was that had looked at him from the window of the house maisie was still talking on he interrupted her brusquely i really came to say goodbye and to thank you for all your kindness youre not going away there was alarm in her voice he smiled sideways at her a crooked smile pathetic and attractive yes he said to africa africa maisie echoed the word blankly before she could pull herself together he had shaken her by the hand and gone she was left standing there her hands clenched by her sides an angry spot of colour in each cheek below on the doorstep john segrave came face to face with allegra coming in from the street she was in black her face white and lifeless she took one glance at him then drew him into a small morning room maisie told you she said you know he nodded but what does it matter youre all right it it leaves some people out she looked at him sombrely mournfully you are all right he repeated i dont know she almost whispered it i dont know i told you about my dreams and when i play when im at the piano those others come and take hold of my hands he was staring at her paralysed for one instant as she spoke something looked out from her eyes it was gone in a flash but he knew it it was the thing that had looked out from the house she caught his momentary recoil you see she whispered you see but i wish maisie hadnt told you it takes everything from you everything yes there wont even be the dreams left for now youll never dare to dream of the house again the west african sun poured down and the heat was intense john segrave continued to moan i cant find it i cant find it the little english doctor with the red head and the tremendous jaw scowled down upon his patient in that bullying manner which he had made his own hes always saying that what does he mean he speaks i think of a house monsieur the soft voiced sister of charity from the roman catholic mission spoke with her gentle detachment as she too looked down on the stricken man a house eh well hes got to get it out of his head or we shant pull him through its on his mind segrave segrave the wandering attention was fixed the eyes rested with recognition on the doctors face look here youre going to pull through im going to pull you through but youve got to stop worrying about this house it cant run away you know so dont bother about looking for it now all right he seemed obedient i suppose it cant very well run away if its never been there at all of course not the doctor laughed his cheery laugh now youll be all right in no time and with a boisterous bluntness of manner he took his departure segrave lay thinking the fever had abated for the moment and he could think clearly and lucidly he must find that house for ten years he had dreaded finding it the thought that he might come upon it unawares had been his greatest terror and then he remembered when his fears were quite lulled to rest one day it had found him he recalled clearly his first haunting terror and then his sudden his exquisite relief for after all the house was empty quite empty and exquisitely peaceful it was as he remembered it ten years before he had not forgotten there was a huge black furniture van moving slowly away from the house the last tenant of course moving out with his goods he went up to the men in charge of the van and spoke to them there was something rather sinister about that van it was so very black the horses were black too with freely flowing manes and tails and the men all wore black clothes and gloves it all reminded him of something else something that he couldnt remember yes he had been quite right the last tenant was moving out as his lease was up the house was to stand empty for the present until the owner came back from abroad and waking he had been full of the peaceful beauty of the empty house a month after that he had received a letter from maisie she wrote to him perseveringly once a month in it she told him that allegra kerr had died in the same home as her mother and wasnt it dreadfully sad though of course a merciful release it had really been very odd indeed coming after his dream like that he didnt quite understand it all but it was odd and the worst of it was that hed never been able to find the house since somehow hed forgotten the way the fever began to take hold of him once more he tossed restlessly of course hed forgotten the house was on high ground he must climb to get there but it was hot work climbing cliffs dreadfully hot up up up oh he had slipped he must start again from the bottom up up up days passed weeks he wasnt sure that years didnt go by and he was still climbing once he heard the doctors voice but he couldnt stop climbing to listen besides the doctor would tell him to leave off looking for the house he thought it was an ordinary house he didnt know he remembered suddenly that he must be calm very calm you couldnt find the house unless you were very calm it was no use looking for the house in a hurry or being excited if he could only keep calm but it was so hot hot it was cold yes cold these werent cliffs they were icebergs jagged cold icebergs he was so tired he wouldnt go on looking it was no good ah here was a lane that was better than icebergs anyway how pleasant and shady it was in the cool green lane and those trees they were splendid they were rather like what he couldnt remember but it didnt matter ah here were flowers all golden and blue how lovely it all was and how strangely familiar of course he had been here before there through the trees was the gleam of the house standing on the high ground how beautiful it was the green lane and the trees and the flowers were as nothing to the paramount the all satisfying beauty of the house he hastened his steps to think that he had never yet been inside how unbelievably stupid of him when he had the key in his pocket all the time and of course the beauty of the exterior was as nothing to the beauty that lay within especially now that the owner had come back from abroad he mounted the steps to the great door cruel strong hands were dragging him back they fought him dragging him to and fro backwards and forwards the doctor was shaking him roaring in his ear hold on man you can dont let go dont let go his eyes were alight with the fierceness of one who sees an enemy segrave wondered who the enemy was the black robed nun was praying that too was strange and all he wanted was to be left alone to go back to the house for every minute the house was growing fainter that of course was because the doctor was so strong he wasnt strong enough to fight the doctor if he only could but stop there was another way the way dreams went in the moment of waking no strength could stop them they just flitted past the doctors hands wouldnt be able to hold him if he slipped just slipped yes that was the way the white walls were visible once more the doctors voice was fainter his hands were barely felt he knew now how dreams laugh when they give you the slip he was at the door of the house the exquisite stillness was unbroken he put the key in the lock and turned it just a moment he waited to realize to the full the perfect the ineffable the all satisfying completeness of joy then he passed over the threshold five

THE LONELY GOD, he stood on a shelf in the british museum alone and forlorn amongst a company of obviously more important deities ranged round the four walls these greater personages all seemed to display an overwhelming sense of their own superiority the pedestal of each was duly inscribed with the land and race that had been proud to possess him there was no doubt of their position they were divinities of importance and recognized as such only the little god in the corner was aloof and remote from their company roughly hewn out of grey stone his features almost totally obliterated by time and exposure he sat there in isolation his elbows on his knees and his head buried in his hands a lonely little god in a strange country there was no inscription to tell the land whence he came he was indeed lost without honour or renown a pathetic little figure very far from home no one noticed him no one stopped to look at him why should they he was so insignificant a block of grey stone in a corner on either side of him were two mexican gods worn smooth with age placid idols with folded hands and cruel mouths curved in a smile that showed openly their contempt of humanity there was also a rotund violently self assertive little god with a clenched fist who evidently suffered from a swollen sense of his own importance but passers by stopped to give him a glance sometimes even if it was only to laugh at the contrast of his absurd pomposity with the smiling indifference of his mexican companions and the little lost god sat on there hopelessly his head in his hands as he had sat year in and year out till one day the impossible happened and he found a worshipper any letters for me the hall porter removed a packet of letters from a pigeon hole gave a cursory glance through them and said in a wooden voice nothing for you sir frank oliver sighed as he walked out of the club again there was no particular reason why there should have been anything for him very few people wrote to him ever since he had returned from burma in the spring he had become conscious of a growing and increasing loneliness frank oliver was a man just over forty and the last eighteen years of his life had been spent in various parts of the globe with brief furloughs in england now that he had retired and come home to live for good he realized for the first time how very much alone in the world he was true there was his sister greta married to a yorkshire clergyman very busy with parochial duties and the bringing up of a family of small children greta was naturally very fond of her only brother but equally naturally she had very little time to give him then there was his old friend tom hurley tom was married to a nice bright cheerful girl very energetic and practical of whom frank was secretly afraid she told him brightly that he must not be a crabbed old bachelor and was always producing nice girls frank oliver found that he never had anything to say to these nice girls they persevered with him for a while then gave him up as hopeless and yet he was not really unsociable he had a great longing for companionship and sympathy and ever since he had been back in england he had become aware of a growing discouragement he had been away too long he was out of tune with the times he spent long aimless days wandering about wondering what on earth he was to do with himself next it was on one of these days that he strolled into the british museum he was interested in asiatic curiosities and so it was that he chanced upon the lonely god its charm held him at once here was something vaguely akin to himself here too was someone lost and astray in a strange land he became in the habit of paying frequent visits to the museum just to glance in on the little grey stone figure in its obscure place on the high shelf rough luck on the little chap he thought to himself probably had a lot of fuss made about him once kowtowing and offerings and all the rest of it he had begun to feel such a proprietary right in his little friend it really almost amounted to a sense of actual ownership that he was inclined to be resentful when he found that the little god had made a second conquest he had discovered the lonely god nobody else he felt had a right to interfere but after the first flash of indignation he was forced to smile at himself for this second worshipper was such a little bit of a thing such a ridiculous pathetic creature in a shabby black coat and skirt that had seen its best days she was young a little over twenty he should judge with fair hair and blue eyes and a wistful droop to her mouth her hat especially appealed to his chivalry she had evidently trimmed it herself and it made such a brave attempt to be smart that its failure was pathetic she was obviously a lady though a poverty stricken one and he immediately decided in his own mind that she was a governess and alone in the world he soon found out that her days for visiting the god were tuesdays and fridays and she always arrived at ten oclock as soon as the museum was open at first he disliked her intrusion but little by little it began to form one of the principal interests of his monotonous life indeed the fellow devotee was fast ousting the object of devotion from his position of preeminence the days that he did not see the little lonely lady as he called her to himself were blank perhaps she too was equally interested in him though she endeavoured to conceal the fact with studious unconcern but little by little a sense of fellowship was slowly growing between them though as yet they had exchanged no spoken word the truth of the matter was the man was too shy he argued to himself that very likely she had not even noticed him some inner sense gave the lie to that instantly that she would consider it a great impertinence and finally that he had not the least idea what to say but fate or the little god was kind and sent him an inspiration or what he regarded as such with infinite delight in his own cunning he purchased a womans handkerchief a frail little affair of cambric and lace which he almost feared to touch and thus armed he followed her as she departed and stopped her in the egyptian room excuse me but is this yours he tried to speak with airy unconcern and signally failed the lonely lady took it and made a pretence of examining it with minute care no it is not mine she handed it back and added with what he felt guiltily was a suspicious glance its quite a new one the price is still on it but he was unwilling to admit that he had been found out he started on an overplausible flow of explanation you see i picked it up under that big case it was just by the farthest leg of it he derived great relief from this detailed account so as you had been standing there i thought it must be yours and came after you with it she said again no it isnt mine and added as if with a sense of ungraciousness thank you the conversation came to an awkward standstill the girl stood there pink and embarrassed evidently uncertain how to retreat with dignity he made a desperate effort to take advantage of his opportunity i i didnt know there was anyone else in london who cared for our little lonely god till you came she answered eagerly forgetting her reserve do you call him that too apparently if she had noticed his pronoun she did not resent it she had been startled into sympathy and his quiet of course seemed the most natural rejoinder in the world again there was a silence but this time it was a silence born of understanding it was the lonely lady who broke it in a sudden remembrance of the conventionalities she drew herself up to her full height and with an almost ridiculous assumption of dignity for so small a person she observed in chilling accents i must be going now good morning and with a slight stiff inclination of her head she walked away holding herself very erect by all acknowledged standards frank oliver ought to have felt rebuffed but it is a regrettable sign of his rapid advance in depravity that he merely murmured to himself little darling he was soon to repent of his temerity however for ten days his little lady never came near the museum he was in despair he had frightened her away she would never come back he was a brute a villain he would never see her again in his distress he haunted the british museum all day long she might merely have changed her time of coming he soon began to know the adjacent rooms by heart and he contracted a lasting hatred of mummies the guardian policeman observed him with suspicion when he spent three hours poring over assyrian hieroglyphics and the contemplation of endless vases of all ages nearly drove him mad with boredom but one day his patience was rewarded she came again rather pinker than usual and trying hard to appear self possessed he greeted her with cheerful friendliness good morning it is ages since youve been here good morning she let the words slip out with icy frigidity and coldly ignored the end part of his sentence but he was desperate look here he stood confronting her with pleading eyes that reminded her irresistibly of a large faithful dog wont you be friends im all alone in london all alone in the world and i believe you are too we ought to be friends besides our little god has introduced us she looked up half doubtfully but there was a faint smile quivering at the corners of her mouth has he of course it was the second time he had used this extremely positive form of assurance and now as before it did not fail of its effect for after a minute or two the girl said in that slightly royal manner of hers very well thats splendid he replied gruffly but there was something in his voice as he said it that made the girl glance at him swiftly with a sharp impulse of pity and so the queer friendship began twice a week they met at the shrine of a little heathen idol at first they confined their conversation solely to him he was as it were at once a palliation of and an excuse for their friendship the question of his origin was widely discussed the man insisted on attributing to him the most bloodthirsty characteristics he depicted him as the terror and dread of his native land insatiable for human sacrifice and bowed down to by his people in fear and trembling in the contrast between his former greatness and his present insignificance there lay according to the man all the pathos of the situation the lonely lady would have none of this theory he was essentially a kind little god she insisted she doubted whether he had ever been very powerful if he had been so she argued he would not now be lost and friendless and anyway he was a dear little god and she loved him and she hated to think of him sitting there day after day with all those other horrid supercilious things jeering at him because you could see they did after this vehement outburst the little lady was quite out of breath that topic exhausted they naturally began to talk of themselves he found out that his surmise was correct she was a nursery governess to a family of children who lived at hampstead he conceived an instant dislike of these children of ted who was five and really not naughty only mischievous of the twins who were rather trying and of molly who wouldnt do anything she was told but was such a dear you couldnt be cross with her those children bully you he said grimly and accusingly to her they do not she retorted with spirit i am extremely stern with them oh ye gods he laughed but she made him apologize humbly for his scepticism she was an orphan she told him quite alone in the world gradually he told her something of his own life of his official life which had been painstaking and mildly successful and of his unofficial pastime which was the spoiling of yards of canvas of course i dont know anything about it he explained but i have always felt i could paint something some day i can sketch pretty decently but id like to do a real picture of something a chap who knew once told me that my technique wasnt bad she was interested pressed for details i am sure you paint awfully well he shook his head no ive begun several things lately and chucked them up in despair i always thought that when i had the time it would be plain sailing i have been storing up that idea for years but now like everything else i suppose ive left it too late nothings too late ever said the little lady with the vehement earnestness of the very young he smiled down on her you think not child its too late for some things for me and the little lady laughed at him and nicknamed him methuselah they were beginning to feel curiously at home in the british museum the solid and sympathetic policeman who patrolled the galleries was a man of tact and on the appearance of the couple he usually found that his onerous duties of guardianship were urgently needed in the adjoining assyrian room one day the man took a bold step he invited her out to tea at first she demurred i have no time i am not free i can come some mornings because the children have french lessons nonsense said the man you could manage one day kill off an aunt or a second cousin or something but come well go to a little abc shop near here and have buns for tea i know you must love buns yes the penny kind with currants and a lovely glaze on top  they are such plump dear things  there is something frank oliver said solemnly infinitely comforting about a bun so it was arranged and the little governess came wearing quite an expensive hothouse rose in her belt in honour of the occasion he had noticed that of late she had a strained worried look and it was more apparent than ever this afternoon as she poured out the tea at the little marble topped table children been bothering you he asked solicitously she shook her head she had seemed curiously disinclined to talk about the children lately theyre all right i never mind them dont you his sympathetic tone seemed to distress her unwarrantably oh no it was never that but but indeed i was lonely i was indeed her tone was almost pleading he said quickly touched yes yes child i know i know after a minutes pause he remarked in a cheerful tone do you know you havent even asked my name yet she held up a protesting hand please i dont want to know it and dont ask mine let us be just two lonely people whove come together and made friends it makes it so much more wonderful and and different he said slowly and thoughtfully very well in an otherwise lonely world well be two people who have just each other it was a little different from her way of putting it and she seemed to find it difficult to go on with the conversation instead she bent lower and lower over her plate till only the crown of her hat was visible thats rather a nice hat he said by way of restoring her equanimity i trimmed it myself she informed him proudly i thought so the moment i saw it he answered saying the wrong thing with cheerful ignorance im afraid it is not as fashionable as i meant it to be i think its a perfectly lovely hat he said loyally again constraint settled down upon them frank oliver broke the silence bravely little lady i didnt mean to tell you yet but i cant help it i love you i want you i loved you from the first moment i saw you standing there in your little black suit dearest if two lonely people were together why there would be no more loneliness and id work oh how id work id paint you i could i know i could oh my little girl i cant live without you i cant indeed  his little lady was looking at him very steadily but what she said was quite the last thing he expected her to say very quietly and distinctly she said you bought that handkerchief he was amazed at this proof of feminine perspicacity and still more amazed at her remembering it against him now surely after this lapse of time it might have been forgiven him yes i did he acknowledged humbly i wanted an excuse to speak to you are you very angry he waited meekly for her words of condemnation i think it was sweet of you cried the little lady with vehemence just sweet of you her voice ended uncertainly frank oliver went on in his gruff tone tell me child is it impossible i know im an ugly rough old fellow    the lonely lady interrupted him no youre not i wouldnt have you different not in any way i love you just as you are do you understand not because im sorry for you not because im alone in the world and want someone to be fond of me and take care of me but because youre just you now do you understand is it true he asked half in a whisper and she answered steadily yes its true  the wonder of it overpowered them at last he said whimsically so weve fallen upon heaven dearest in an abc shop she answered in a voice that held tears and laughter but terrestrial heavens are short lived the little lady started up with an exclamation id no idea how late it was i must go at once ill see you home no no no he was forced to yield to her insistence and merely accompanied her as far as the tube station goodbye dearest she clung to his hand with an intensity that he remembered afterwards only goodbye till tomorrow he answered cheerfully ten oclock as usual and well tell each other our names and our histories and be frightfully practical and prosaic goodbye to heaven though she whispered it will be with us always sweetheart she smiled back at him but with that same sad appeal that disquieted him and which he could not fathom then the relentless lift dragged her down out of sight he was strangely disturbed by those last words of hers but he put them resolutely out of his mind and substituted radiant anticipations of tomorrow in their stead at ten oclock he was there in the accustomed place for the first time he noticed how malevolently the other idols looked down upon him it almost seemed as if they were possessed of some secret evil knowledge affecting him over which they were gloating he was uneasily aware of their dislike the little lady was late why didnt she come the atmosphere of this place was getting on his nerves never had his own little friend their god seemed so hopelessly impotent as today a helpless lump of stone hugging his own despair his cogitations were interrupted by a small sharp faced boy who had stepped up to him and was earnestly scrutinizing him from head to foot apparently satisfied with the result of his observations he held out a letter for me it had no superscription he took it and the sharp boy decamped with extraordinary rapidity frank oliver read the letter slowly and unbelievingly it was quite short dearest i can never marry you please forget that i ever came into your life at all and try to forgive me if i have hurt you dont try to find me because it will be no good it is really goodbye the lonely lady there was a postscript which had evidently been scribbled at the last moment i do love you i do indeed and that little impulsive postscript was all the comfort he had in the weeks that followed needless to say he disobeyed her injunction not to try to find her but all in vain she had vanished completely and he had no clue to trace her by he advertised despairingly imploring her in veiled terms at least to explain the mystery but blank silence rewarded his efforts she was gone never to return and then it was that for the first time in his life he really began to paint his technique had always been good now craftsmanship and inspiration went hand in hand the picture that made his name and brought him renown was accepted and hung in the academy and was accounted to be the picture of the year no less for the exquisite treatment of the subject than for the masterly workmanship and technique a certain amount of mystery too rendered it more interesting to the general outside public his inspiration had come quite by chance a fairy story in a magazine had taken a hold on his imagination it was the story of a fortunate princess who had always had everything she wanted did she express a wish it was instantly gratified a desire it was granted she had a devoted father and mother great riches beautiful clothes and jewels slaves to wait upon her and fulfil her lightest whim laughing maidens to bear her company all that the heart of a princess could desire the handsomest and richest princes paid her court and sued in vain for her hand and were willing to kill any number of dragons to prove their devotion and yet the loneliness of the princess was greater than that of the poorest beggar in the land he read no more the ultimate fate of the princess interested him not at all a picture had risen up before him of the pleasure laden princess with the sad solitary soul surfeited with happiness suffocated with luxury starving in the palace of plenty he began painting with furious energy the fierce joy of creation possessed him he represented the princess surrounded by her court reclining on a divan a riot of eastern colour pervaded the picture the princess wore a marvellous gown of strange coloured embroideries her golden hair fell round her and on her head was a heavy jewelled circlet her maidens surrounded her and princes knelt at her feet bearing rich gifts the whole scene was one of luxury and richness but the face of the princess was turned away she was oblivious of the laughter and mirth around her her gaze was fixed on a dark and shadowy corner where stood a seemingly incongruous object a little grey stone idol with its head buried in its hand in a quaint abandonment of despair was it so incongruous the eyes of the young princess rested on it with a strange sympathy as though a dawning sense of her own isolation drew her glance irresistibly they were akin these two the world was at her feet yet she was alone a lonely princess looking at a lonely little god all london talked of this picture and greta wrote a few hurried words of congratulation from yorkshire and tom hurleys wife besought frank oliver to come for a weekend and meet a really delightful girl a great admirer of your work frank oliver laughed once sardonically and threw the letter into the fire success had come but what was the use of it he only wanted one thing that little lonely lady who had gone out of his life for ever it was ascot cup day and the policeman on duty in a certain section of the british museum rubbed his eyes and wondered if he were dreaming for one does not expect to see there an ascot vision in a lace frock and a marvelous hat a veritable nymph as imagined by a parisian genius the policeman stared in rapturous admiration the lonely god was not perhaps so surprised he may have been in his way a powerful little god at any rate here was one worshipper brought back to the fold the little lonely lady was staring up at him and her lips moved in a rapid whisper dear little god oh dear little god please help me oh please do help me perhaps the little god was flattered perhaps if he was indeed the ferocious unappeasable deity frank oliver had imagined him the long weary years and the march of civilization had softened his cold stone heart perhaps the lonely lady had been right all along and he was really a kind little god perhaps it was merely a coincidence however that may be it was at that very moment that frank oliver walked slowly and sadly through the door of the assyrian room he raised his head and saw the parisian nymph in another moment his arm was round her and she was stammering out rapid broken words i was so lonely you know you must have read that story i wrote you couldnt have painted that picture unless you had and unless you had understood the princess was i i had everything and yet i was lonely beyond words one day i was going to a fortune tellers and i borrowed my maids clothes i came in here on the way and saw you looking at the little god thats how it all began i pretended oh it was hateful of me and i went on pretending and afterwards i didnt dare confess that i had told you such dreadful lies i thought you would be disgusted at the way i had deceived you i couldnt bear you to find out so i went away then i wrote that story and yesterday i saw your picture it was your picture wasnt it only the gods really know the word ingratitude it is to be presumed that the lonely little god knew the black ingratitude of human nature as a divinity he had unique opportunities of observing it yet in the hour of trial he who had had sacrifices innumerable offered to him made sacrifice in his turn he sacrificed his only two worshippers in a strange land and it showed him to be a great little god in his way since he sacrificed all that he had through the chinks in his fingers he watched them go hand in hand without a backward glance two happy people who had found heaven and had no need of him any longer what was he after all but a very lonely little god in a strange land six

would never see her again in his distress he haunted the british museum all day long she might merely have changed her time of coming he soon began to know the adjacent rooms by heart and he contracted a lasting hatred of mummies the guardian policeman observed him with suspicion when he spent three hours poring over assyrian hieroglyphics and the contemplation of endless vases of all ages nearly drove him mad with boredom but one day his patience was rewarded she came again rather pinker than usual and trying hard to appear self possessed he greeted her with cheerful friendliness good morning it is ages since youve been here good morning she let the words slip out with icy frigidity and coldly ignored the end part of his sentence but he was desperate look here he stood confronting her with pleading eyes that reminded her irresistibly of a large faithful dog wont you be friends im all alone in london all alone in the world and i believe you are too we ought to be friends besides our little god has introduced us she looked up half doubtfully but there was a faint smile quivering at the corners of her mouth has he of course it was the second time he had used this extremely positive form of assurance and now as before it did not fail of its effect for after a minute or two the girl said in that slightly royal manner of hers very well thats splendid he replied gruffly but there was something in his voice as he said it that made the girl glance at him swiftly with a sharp impulse of pity and so the queer friendship began twice a week they met at the shrine of a little heathen idol at first they confined their conversation solely to him he was as it were at once a palliation of and an excuse for their friendship the question of his origin was widely discussed the man insisted on attributing to him the most bloodthirsty characteristics he depicted him as the terror and dread of his native land insatiable for human sacrifice and bowed down to by his people in fear and trembling in the contrast between his former greatness and his present insignificance there lay according to the man all the pathos of the situation the lonely lady would have none of this theory he was essentially a kind little god she insisted she doubted whether he had ever been very powerful if he had been so she argued he would not now be lost and friendless and anyway he was a dear little god and she loved him and she hated to think of him sitting there day after day with all those other horrid supercilious things jeering at him because you could see they did after this vehement outburst the little lady was quite out of breath that topic exhausted they naturally began to talk of themselves he found out that his surmise was correct she was a nursery governess to a family of children who lived at hampstead he conceived an instant dislike of these children of ted who was five and really not naughty only mischievous of the twins who were rather trying and of molly who wouldnt do anything she was told but was such a dear you couldnt be cross with her those children bully you he said grimly and accusingly to her they do not she retorted with spirit i am extremely stern with them oh ye gods he laughed but she made him apologize humbly for his scepticism she was an orphan she told him quite alone in the world gradually he told her something of his own life of his official life which had been painstaking and mildly successful and of his unofficial pastime which was the spoiling of yards of canvas of course i dont know anything about it he explained but i have always felt i could paint something some day i can sketch pretty decently but id like to do a real picture of something a chap who knew once told me that my technique wasnt bad she was interested pressed for details i am sure you paint awfully well he shook his head no ive begun several things lately and chucked them up in despair i always thought that when i had the time it would be plain sailing i have been storing up that idea for years but now like everything else i suppose ive left it too late nothings too late ever said the little lady with the vehement earnestness of the very young he smiled down on her you think not child its too late for some things for me and the little lady laughed at him and nicknamed him methuselah they were beginning to feel curiously at home in the british museum the solid and sympathetic policeman who patrolled the galleries was a man of tact and on the appearance of the couple he usually found that his onerous duties of guardianship were urgently needed in the adjoining assyrian room one day the man took a bold step he invited her out to tea at first she demurred i have no time i am not free i can come some mornings because the children have french lessons nonsense said the man you could manage one day kill off an aunt or a second cousin or something but come well go to a little abc shop near here and have buns for tea i know you must love buns yes the penny kind with currants and a lovely glaze on top  they are such plump dear things  there is something frank oliver said solemnly infinitely comforting about a bun so it was arranged and the little governess came wearing quite an expensive hothouse rose in her belt in honour of the occasion he had noticed that of late she had a strained worried look and it was more apparent than ever this afternoon as she poured out the tea at the little marble topped table children been bothering you he asked solicitously she shook her head she had seemed curiously disinclined to talk about the children lately theyre all right i never mind them dont you his sympathetic tone seemed to distress her unwarrantably oh no it was never that but but indeed i was lonely i was indeed her tone was almost pleading he said quickly touched yes yes child i know i know after a minutes pause he remarked in a cheerful tone do you know you havent even asked my name yet she held up a protesting hand please i dont want to know it and dont ask mine let us be just two lonely people whove come together and made friends it makes it so much more wonderful and and different he said slowly and thoughtfully very well in an otherwise lonely world well be two people who have just each other it was a little different from her way of putting it and she seemed to find it difficult to go on with the conversation instead she bent lower and lower over her plate till only the crown of her hat was visible thats rather a nice hat he said by way of restoring her equanimity i trimmed it myself she informed him proudly i thought so the moment i saw it he answered saying the wrong thing with cheerful ignorance im afraid it is not as fashionable as i meant it to be i think its a perfectly lovely hat he said loyally again constraint settled down upon them frank oliver broke the silence bravely little lady i didnt mean to tell you yet but i cant help it i love you i want you i loved you from the first moment i saw you standing there in your little black suit dearest if two lonely people were together why there would be no more loneliness and id work oh how id work id paint you i could i know i could oh my little girl i cant live without you i cant indeed  his little lady was looking at him very steadily but what she said was quite the last thing he expected her to say very quietly and distinctly she said you bought that handkerchief he was amazed at this proof of feminine perspicacity and still more amazed at her remembering it against him now surely after this lapse of time it might have been forgiven him yes i did he acknowledged humbly i wanted an excuse to speak to you are you very angry he waited meekly for her words of condemnation i think it was sweet of you cried the little lady with vehemence just sweet of you her voice ended uncertainly frank oliver went on in his gruff tone tell me child is it impossible i know im an ugly rough old fellow    the lonely lady interrupted him no youre not i wouldnt have you different not in any way i love you just as you are do you understand not because im sorry for you not because im alone in the world and want someone to be fond of me and take care of me but because youre just you now do you understand is it true he asked half in a whisper and she answered steadily yes its true  the wonder of it overpowered them at last he said whimsically so weve fallen upon heaven dearest in an abc shop she answered in a voice that held tears and laughter but terrestrial heavens are short lived the little lady started up with an exclamation id no idea how late it was i must go at once ill see you home no no no he was forced to yield to her insistence and merely accompanied her as far as the tube station goodbye dearest she clung to his hand with an intensity that he remembered afterwards only goodbye till tomorrow he answered cheerfully ten oclock as usual and well tell each other our names and our histories and be frightfully practical and prosaic goodbye to heaven though she whispered it will be with us always sweetheart she smiled back at him but with that same sad appeal that disquieted him and which he could not fathom then the relentless lift dragged her down out of sight he was strangely disturbed by those last words of hers but he put them resolutely out of his mind and substituted radiant anticipations of tomorrow in their stead at ten oclock he was there in the accustomed place for the first time he noticed how malevolently the other idols looked down upon him it almost seemed as if they were possessed of some secret evil knowledge affecting him over which they were gloating he was uneasily aware of their dislike the little lady was late why didnt she come the atmosphere of this place was getting on his nerves never had his own little friend their god seemed so hopelessly impotent as today a helpless lump of stone hugging his own despair his cogitations were interrupted by a small sharp faced boy who had stepped up to him and was earnestly scrutinizing him from head to foot apparently satisfied with the result of his observations he held out a letter for me it had no superscription he took it and the sharp boy decamped with extraordinary rapidity frank oliver read the letter slowly and unbelievingly it was quite short dearest i can never marry you please forget that i ever came into your life at all and try to forgive me if i have hurt you dont try to find me because it will be no good it is really goodbye the lonely lady there was a postscript which had evidently been scribbled at the last moment i do love you i do indeed and that little impulsive postscript was all the comfort he had in the weeks that followed needless to say he disobeyed her injunction not to try to find her but all in vain she had vanished completely and he had no clue to trace her by he advertised despairingly imploring her in veiled terms at least to explain the mystery but blank silence rewarded his efforts she was gone never to return and then it was that for the first time in his life he really began to paint his technique had always been good now craftsmanship and inspiration went hand in hand the picture that made his name and brought him renown was accepted and hung in the academy and was accounted to be the picture of the year no less for the exquisite treatment of the subject than for the masterly workmanship and technique a certain amount of mystery too rendered it more interesting to the general outside public his inspiration had come quite by chance a fairy story in a magazine had taken a hold on his imagination it was the story of a fortunate princess who had always had everything she wanted did she express a wish it was instantly gratified a desire it was granted she had a devoted father and mother great riches beautiful clothes and jewels slaves to wait upon her and fulfil her lightest whim laughing maidens to bear her company all that the heart of a princess could desire the handsomest and richest princes paid her court and sued in vain for her hand and were willing to kill any number of dragons to prove their devotion and yet the loneliness of the princess was greater than that of the poorest beggar in the land he read no more the ultimate fate of the princess interested him not at all a picture had risen up before him of the pleasure laden princess with the sad solitary soul surfeited with happiness suffocated with luxury starving in the palace of plenty he began painting with furious energy the fierce joy of creation possessed him he represented the princess surrounded by her court reclining on a divan a riot of eastern colour pervaded the picture the princess wore a marvellous gown of strange coloured embroideries her golden hair fell round her and on her head was a heavy jewelled circlet her maidens surrounded her and princes knelt at her feet bearing rich gifts the whole scene was one of luxury and richness but the face of the princess was turned away she was oblivious of the laughter and mirth around her her gaze was fixed on a dark and shadowy corner where stood a seemingly incongruous object a little grey stone idol with its head buried in its hand in a quaint abandonment of despair was it so incongruous the eyes of the young princess rested on it with a strange sympathy as though a dawning sense of her own isolation drew her glance irresistibly they were akin these two the world was at her feet yet she was alone a lonely princess looking at a lonely little god all london talked of this picture and greta wrote a few hurried words of congratulation from yorkshire and tom hurleys wife besought frank oliver to come for a weekend and meet a really delightful girl a great admirer of your work frank oliver laughed once sardonically and threw the letter into the fire success had come but what was the use of it he only wanted one thing that little lonely lady who had gone out of his life for ever it was ascot cup day and the policeman on duty in a certain section of the british museum rubbed his eyes and wondered if he were dreaming for one does not expect to see there an ascot vision in a lace frock and a marvelous hat a veritable nymph as imagined by a parisian genius the policeman stared in rapturous admiration the lonely god was not perhaps so surprised he may have been in his way a powerful little god at any rate here was one worshipper brought back to the fold the little lonely lady was staring up at him and her lips moved in a rapid whisper dear little god oh dear little god please help me oh please do help me perhaps the little god was flattered perhaps if he was indeed the ferocious unappeasable deity frank oliver had imagined him the long weary years and the march of civilization had softened his cold stone heart perhaps the lonely lady had been right all along and he was really a kind little god perhaps it was merely a coincidence however that may be it was at that very moment that frank oliver walked slowly and sadly through the door of the assyrian room he raised his head and saw the parisian nymph in another moment his arm was round her and she was stammering out rapid broken words i was so lonely you know you must have read that story i wrote you couldnt have painted that picture unless you had and unless you had understood the princess was i i had everything and yet i was lonely beyond words one day i was going to a fortune tellers and i borrowed my maids clothes i came in here on the way and saw you looking at the little god thats how it all began i pretended oh it was hateful of me and i went on pretending and afterwards i didnt dare confess that i had told you such dreadful lies i thought you would be disgusted at the way i had deceived you i couldnt bear you to find out so i went away then i wrote that story and yesterday i saw your picture it was your picture wasnt it only the gods really know the word ingratitude it is to be presumed that the lonely little god knew the black ingratitude of human nature as a divinity he had unique opportunities of observing it yet in the hour of trial he who had had sacrifices innumerable offered to him made sacrifice in his turn he sacrificed his only two worshippers in a strange land and it showed him to be a great little god in his way since he sacrificed all that he had through the chinks in his fingers he watched them go hand in hand without a backward glance two happy people who had found heaven and had no need of him any longer what was he after all but a very lonely little god in a strange land six

MANX GOLD, old mylecharane livd up on the broo where furby slopes down to the wold his croft was all golden with cushag and furze his daughter was fair to behold o father they say youve plenty of store but hidden all out of the way no gold can i see but its glint on the gorse then what have you done with it pray my gold is locked up in a coffer of oak which i dropped in the tide and it sank and there it lies fixed like an anchor of hope all bright and as safe as the bank i like that song i said appreciatively as fenella finished you should do said fenella its about our ancestor yours and mine uncle myless grandfather he made a fortune out of smuggling and hid it somewhere and no one ever knew where ancestry is fenellas strong point she takes an interest in all her forebears my tendencies are strictly modern the difficult present and the uncertain future absorb all my energy but i like hearing fenella singing old manx ballads fenella is very charming she is my first cousin and also from time to time my fiance in moods of financial optimism we are engaged when a corresponding wave of pessimism sweeps over us and we realize that we shall not be able to marry for at least ten years we break it off didnt anyone ever try to find the treasure i inquired of course but they never did perhaps they didnt look scientifically uncle myles had a jolly good try said fenella he said anyone with intelligence ought to be able to solve a little problem like that that sounded to me very like our uncle myles a cranky and eccentric old gentleman who lived in the isle of man and who was much given to didactic pronouncements it was at that moment that the post came and the letter good heavens cried fenella talk of the devil i mean angels uncle myles is dead both she and i had only seen our eccentric relative on two occasions so we could neither of us pretend to a very deep grief the letter was from a firm of lawyers in douglas and it informed us that under the will of mr myles mylecharane deceased fenella and i were joint inheritors of his estate which consisted of a house near douglas and an infinitesimal income enclosed was a sealed envelope which mr mylecharane had directed should be forwarded to fenella at his death this letter we opened and read its surprising contents i reproduce it in full since it was a truly characteristic document my dear fenella and juan for i take it that where one of you is the other will not be far away or so gossip has whispered you may remember having heard me say that anyone displaying a little intelligence could easily find the treasure concealed by my amiable scoundrel of a grandfather i displayed that intelligence and my reward was four chests of solid gold quite like a fairy story is it not of living relations i have only four you two my nephew ewan corjeag whom i have always heard is a thoroughly bad lot and a cousin a doctor fayll of whom i have heard very little and that little not always good my estate proper i am leaving to you and fenella but i feel a certain obligation laid upon me with regard to this treasure which has fallen to my lot solely through my own ingenuity my amiable ancestor would not i feel be satisfied for me to pass it on tamely by inheritance so i in my turn have devised a little problem there are still four chests of treasure though in a more modern form than gold ingots or coins and there are to be four competitors my four living relations it would be fairest to assign one chest to each but the world my children is not fair the race is to the swiftest and often to the most unscrupulous who am i to go against nature you must pit your wits against the other two there will be i fear very little chance for you goodness and innocence are seldom rewarded in this world so strongly do i feel this that i have deliberately cheated unfairness again you notice this letter goes to you twenty four hours in advance of the letters to the other two thus you will have a very good chance of securing the first treasure twenty four hours start if you have any brains at all ought to be sufficient the clues for finding this treasure are to be found at my house in douglas the clues for the second treasure will not be released till the first treasure is found in the second and succeeding cases therefore you will all start even you have my good wishes for success and nothing would please me better than for you to acquire all four chests but for the reasons which i have already stated i think that most unlikely remember that no scruples will stand in dear ewans way do not make the mistake of trusting him in any respect as to dr richard fayll i know little about him but he is i fancy a dark horse good luck to you both but with little hopes of your success your affectionate uncle myles mylecharane as we reached the signature fenella made a leap from my side what is it i cried fenella was rapidly turning the pages of an abc we must get to the isle of man as soon as possible she cried how dare he say we were good and innocent and stupid ill show him juan were going to find all four of these chests and get married and live happily ever afterwards with rolls royces and footmen and marble baths but we must get to the isle of man at once it was twenty four hours later we had arrived in douglas interviewed the lawyers and were now at maughold house facing mrs skillicorn our late uncles housekeeper a somewhat formidable woman who nevertheless relented a little before fenellas eagerness queer ways he had she said liked to set everyone puzzling and contriving but the clues cried fenella the clues deliberately as she did everything mrs skillicorn left the room she returned after an absence of some minutes and held out a folded piece of paper we unfolded it eagerly it contained a doggerel rhyme in my uncles crabbed handwriting four points of the compass so there be s and w n and e east winds are bad for man and beast go south and west and north not east oh said fenella blankly oh said i with much the same intonation mrs skillicorn smiled on us with gloomy relish not much sense to it is there she said helpfully it i dont see how to begin said fenella piteously beginning i said with a cheerfulness i did not feel is always the difficulty once we get going  mrs skillicorn smiled more grimly than ever she was a depressing woman cant you help us asked fenella coaxingly i know nothing about the silly business didnt confide in me your uncle didnt i have told him to put his money in the bank and no nonsense i never knew what he was up to he never went out with any chests or anything of that kind that he didnt you dont know when he hid the stuff whether it was lately or long ago mrs skillicorn shook her head well i said trying to rally there are two possibilities either the treasure is hidden here in the actual grounds or else it may be hidden anywhere on the island it depends on the bulk of course a sudden brain wave occurred to fenella you havent noticed anything missing she said among my uncles things i mean why now its odd your saying that  you have then as i say its odd your saying that snuffboxes theres at least four of them i cant lay my hand on anywhere four of them cried fenella that must be it were on the track lets go out in the garden and look about theres nothing there said mrs skillicorn id know if there were your uncle couldnt have buried anything in the garden without my knowing about it points of the compass are mentioned i said the first thing we need is a map of the island theres one on that desk said mrs skillicorn fenella unfolded it eagerly something fluttered out as she did so i caught it hullo i said this looks like a further clue we both went over it eagerly it appeared to be a rude kind of map there was a cross on it and a circle and a pointing arrow and directions were roughly indicated but it was hardly illuminating we studied it in silence its not very illuminating is it said fenella naturally it wants puzzling over i said we cant expect it to leap to the eye mrs skillicorn interrupted with a suggestion of supper to which we agreed thankfully and could we have some coffee said fenella lots of it very black mrs skillicorn provided us with an excellent meal and at its conclusion a large jug of coffee made its appearance and now said fenella we must get down to it the first thing i said is direction this seems to point clearly to the northeast of the island it seems so lets look at the map we studied the map attentively it all depends on how you take the thing said fenella does the cross represent the treasure or is it something like a church there really ought to be rules that would make it too easy i suppose it would why are there little lines one side of the circle and not the other i dont know are there any more maps anywhere we were sitting in the library there were several excellent maps there were also various guide books descriptive of the island there was a book on folklore there was a book on the history of the island we read them all and at last we formed a possible theory it does seem to fit said fenella at last i mean the two together is a likely conjunction which doesnt seem to occur anywhere else its worth trying anyhow i said i dont think we can do anything more tonight tomorrow first thing well hire a car and go off and try our luck its tomorrow now said fenella half past two just fancy early morning saw us on the road we had hired a car for a week arranging to drive it ourselves fenellas spirits rose as we sped along the excellent road mile after mile if only it wasnt for the other two what fun this would be she said this is where the derby was originally run wasnt it before it was changed to epsom how queer that is to think of i drew her attention to a farmhouse that must be where there is said to be a secret passage running under the sea to that island what fun i love secret passages dont you oh juan were getting quite near now im terribly excited if we should be right five minutes later we abandoned the car everythings in the right position said fenella tremulously we walked on six of them thats right now between these two have you got the compass five minutes later we were standing facing each other an incredulous joy on our faces and on my outstretched palm lay an antique snuffbox we had been successful on our return to maughold house mrs skillicorn met us with the information that two gentlemen had arrived one had departed again but the other was in the library a tall fair man with a florid face rose smilingly from an armchair as we entered the room mr faraker and miss mylecharane delighted to meet you i am your distant cousin dr fayll amusing game all this isnt it his manner was urbane and pleasant but i took an immediate dislike to him i felt that in some way the man was dangerous his pleasant manner was somehow too pleasant and his eyes never met yours fairly im afraid weve got bad news for you i said miss mylecharane and myself have already discovered the first treasure  he took it very well too bad too bad posts from here must be odd barford and i started at once we did not dare to confess the perfidy of uncle myles anyway we shall all start fair for the second round said fenella splendid what about getting down to the clues right away your excellent mrs er skillicorn holds them i believe that wouldnt be fair to mr corjeag said fenella quickly we must wait for him true true i had forgotten we must get in touch with him as quickly as possible i will see to that you two must be tired out and want to rest thereupon he took his departure ewan corjeag must have been unexpectedly difficult to find for it was not till nearly eleven oclock that night that dr fayll rang up he suggested that he and ewan should come over to maughold house at ten oclock the following morning when mrs skillicorn could hand us out the clues that will do splendidly said fenella ten oclock tomorrow we retired to bed tired but happy the following morning we were aroused by mrs skillicorn completely shaken out of her usual pessimistic calm whatever do you think she panted the house has been broken into burglars i exclaimed incredulously has anything been taken not a thing and thats the odd part of it no doubt they were after the silver but the door being locked on the outside they couldnt get any further fenella and i accompanied her to the scene of the outrage which happened to be in her own sitting room the window there had undeniably been forced yet nothing seemed to have been taken it was all rather curious i dont see what they can have been looking for said fenella its not as though there were a treasure chest hidden in the house i agreed facetiously suddenly an idea flashed into my mind i turned to mrs skillicorn the clues the clues you were to give us this morning why to be sure theyre in that top drawer she went across to it why i do declare theres nothing here theyre gone not burglars i said our esteemed relations and i remember uncle myless warning on the subject of unscrupulous dealing clearly he had known what he was talking about a dirty trick hush said fenella suddenly holding up a finger what was that the sound she had caught came plainly to our ears it was a groan and it came from outside we went to the window and leaned out there was a shrubbery growing against this side of the house and we could see nothing but the groan came again and we could see that the bushes seemed to have been disturbed and trampled we hurried down and out round the house the first thing we found was a fallen ladder showing how the thieves had reached the window a few steps further brought us to where a man was lying he was a youngish man dark and he was evidently badly injured for his head was lying in a pool of blood i knelt down beside him we must get a doctor at once im afraid hes dying the gardener was sent off hurriedly i slipped my hand into his breast pocket and brought out a pocket book on it were the initials ec ewan corjeag said fenella the mans eyes opened he said faintly fell from ladder    then lost consciousness again close by his head was a large jagged stone stained with blood its clear enough i said the ladder slipped and he fell striking his head on this stone im afraid its done for him poor fellow so you think that was it said fenella in an odd tone of voice but at that moment the doctor arrived he held out little hope of recovery ewan corjeag was moved into the house and a nurse was sent for to take charge of him nothing could be done and he would die a couple of hours later we had been sent for and were standing by his bed his eyes opened and flickered we are your cousins juan and fenella i said is there anything we can do he made a faint negative motion of the head a whisper came from his lips i bent to catch it do you want the clue im done dont let fayll do you down yes said fenella tell me something like a grin came over his face dye ken  he began then suddenly his head fell over sideways and he died i dont like it said fenella suddenly what dont you like listen juan ewan stole those clues he admits falling from the ladder then where are they weve seen all the contents of his pockets there were three sealed envelopes so mrs skillicorn says those sealed envelopes arent there what do you think then i think there was someone else there someone who jerked away the ladder so that he fell and that stone he never fell on it it was brought from some distance away ive found the mark he was deliberately bashed on the head with it but fenella thats murder yes said fenella very white its murder remember dr fayll never turned up at ten oclock this morning where is he you think hes the murderer yes you know this treasure its a lot of money juan and weve no idea where to look for him i said a pity corjeag couldnt have finished what he was going to say theres one thing might help this was in his hand she handed me a torn snapshot suppose its a clue the murderer snatched it away and never noticed hed left a corner of it behind if we were to find the other half  to do that i said we must find the second treasure lets look at this thing hm i said theres nothing much to go by that seems a kind of tower in the middle of the circle but it would be very hard to identify fenella nodded dr fayll has the important half he knows where to look weve got to find that man juan and watch him of course we wont let him see we suspect i wonder whereabouts in the island he is this minute if we only knew  my mind went back to the dying man suddenly i sat up excitedly fenella i said corjeag wasnt scotch no of course not well then dont you see what he meant i mean no i scribbled something on a piece of paper and tossed it to her whats this the name of a firm that might help us bellman and true who are they lawyers no theyre more in our line private detectives and i proceeded to explain dr fayll to see you said mrs skillicorn we looked at each other twenty four hours had elapsed we had returned from our quest successful for the second time not wishing to draw attention to ourselves we had journeyed in the snaefell a charabanc i wonder if he knows we saw him in the distance murmured fenella its extraordinary if it hadnt been for the hint that photograph gave us  hush and do be careful juan he must be simply furious at our having outwitted him in spite of everything no trace of it appeared in the doctors manner however he entered the room his urbane and charming self and i felt my faith in fenellas theory dwindling what a shocking tragedy he said poor corjeag i suppose he was well trying to steal a march on us retribution was swift well well we scarcely knew him poor fellow you must have wondered why i didnt turn up this morning as arranged i got a fake message corjeags doing i suppose it sent me off on a wild goose chase right across the island and now you two have romped home again how do you do it there was a note of really eager inquiry in his voice which did not escape me cousin ewan was fortunately able to speak just before he died said fenella i was watching the man and i could swear i saw alarm leap into his eyes at her words eh eh whats that he said he was just able to give us a clue as to the whereabouts of the treasure explained fenella oh i see i see ive been clean out of things though curiously enough i myself was in that part of the island you may have seen me strolling round we were so busy said fenella apologetically of course of course you must have run across the thing more or less by accident lucky young people arent you well whats the next programme will mrs skillicorn oblige us with the new clues but it seemed that this third set of clues had been deposited with the lawyers and we all three repaired to the lawyers office where the sealed envelopes were handed over to us the contents were simple a map with a certain area marked off on it and a paper of directions attached in  this place made history ten paces from the landmark to the east then an equal ten paces north stand there looking east two trees are in the line of vision one of them was sacred in this island draw a circle five feet from the spanish chestnut and with head bent walk round look well youll find looks as though we were going to tread on each others toes a bit today commented the doctor true to my policy of apparent friendliness i offered him a lift in our car which he accepted we had lunch at port erin and then started on our search i had debated in my own mind the reason of my uncles depositing this particular set of clues with his lawyer had he foreseen the possibility of a theft and had he determined that not more than one set of clues should fall into the thiefs possession the treasure hunt this afternoon was not without its humour the area of search was limited and we were continually in sight of each other we eyed each other suspiciously each trying to determine whether the other was farther on or had had a brain wave this is all part of uncle myless plan said fenella he wanted us to watch each other and go through all the agonies of thinking the other person was getting there come i said lets get down to it scientifically weve got one definite clue to start on in  this place made history look up the reference books weve got with us and see if we cant hunt that down once we get that  hes looking in that hedge interrupted fenella oh i cant bear it if hes got it  attend to me i said firmly theres really only one way to go about it the proper way there are so few trees on the island that it would be much simpler just to look for a chestnut tree said fenella i pass over the next hour we grew hot and despondent and all the time we were tortured with fear that fayll might be succeeding whilst we failed i remember once reading in a detective story i said how a fellow stuck a paper of writing in a bath of acid and all sorts of other words came out do you think but we havent got a bath of acid i dont think uncle myles could expect expert chemical knowledge but theres common or garden heat  we slipped round the corner of a hedge and in a minute or two i had kindled a few twigs i held the paper as close to the blaze as i dared almost at once i was rewarded by seeing characters begin to appear at the foot of the sheet there were just two words kirkhill station read out fenella just at that moment fayll came round the corner whether he had heard or not we had no means of judging he showed nothing but juan said fenella when he moved away there isnt a kirkhill station she held out the map as she spoke no i said examining it but look here and with a pencil i drew a line on it of course and somewhere on that line  exactly but i wish we knew the exact spot it was then that my second brain wave came to me we do i cried and seizing the pencil again i said look fenella uttered a cry how idiotic she cried and how marvellous what a sell really uncle myles was a most ingenious old gentleman the time had come for the last clue this the lawyer had informed us was not in his keeping it was to be posted to us on receipt of a postcard sent by him he would impart no further information nothing arrived however on the morning it should have done and fenella and i went through agonies believing that fayll had managed somehow to intercept our letter the next day however our fears were calmed and the mystery explained when we received the following illiterate scrawl dear sir or madam escuse delay but have been all sixes and sevens but i do now as mr mylecharane axed me to and send you the piece of riting wot as been in my family many long years the wot he wanted it for i do not know thanking you i am mary kerruish postmark bride i remarked now for the piece of riting handed down in my family upon a rock a sign youll see o tell me what the point of that may be well firstly a near by youll find quite suddenly the light you seek then b a house a cottage with a thatch and wall a meandering lane near by thats all its very unfair to begin with a rock said fenella there are rocks everywhere how can you tell which one has the sign on it if we could settle on the district i said it ought to be fairly easy to find the rock it must have a mark on it pointing in a certain direction and in that direction there will be something hidden which will throw light on the finding of the treasure i think youre right said fenella thats a the new clue will give us a hint where b the cottage is to be found the treasure itself is hidden down a lane alongside the cottage but clearly weve got to find a first owing to the difficulty of the initial step uncle myless last problem proved a real teaser to fenella falls the distinction of unravelling it and even then she did not accomplish it for nearly a week now and then we had come across fayll in our search of rocky districts but the area was a wide one when we finally made our discovery it was late in the evening too late i said to start off to the place indicated fenella disagreed supposing fayll finds it too she said and we wait till tomorrow and he starts off tonight how we should kick ourselves suddenly a marvellous idea occurred to me fenella i said do you still believe that fayll murdered ewan corjeag i do then i think that now weve got our chance to bring the crime home to him that man makes me shiver hes bad all through tell me advertise the fact that weve found a then start off ten to one hell follow us its a lonely place just what would suit his book hell come out in the open if we pretend to find the treasure and then and then i said hell have a little surprise it was close on midnight we had left the car some distance away and were creeping along by the side of a wall fenella had a powerful flashlight which she was using i myself carried a revolver i was taking no chances suddenly with a low cry fenella stopped look juan she cried weve got it at last for a moment i was off my guard led by instinct i whirled round but too late fayll stood six paces away and his revolver covered us both good evening he said this trick is mine youll hand over that treasure if you please would you like me also to hand over something else i asked half a snapshot torn from a dying mans hand you have the other half i think his hand wavered what are you talking about he growled the truths known i said you and corjeag were there together you pulled away the ladder and crashed his head with that stone the police are cleverer than you imagine dr fayll they know do they then by heaven ill swing for three murders instead of one drop fenella i screamed and at the same minute his revolver barked loudly we had both dropped in the heather and before he could fire again uniformed men sprang out from behind the wall where they had been hiding a moment later fayll had been handcuffed and led away i caught fenella in my arms i knew i was right she said tremulously darling i cried it was too risky he might have shot you but he didnt said fenella and we know where the treasure is do we i do see  she scribbled a word well look for it tomorrow there cant be many hiding places there i should say it was just noon when eureka said fenella softly the fourth snuffbox weve got them all uncle myles would be pleased and now  now i said we can be married and live together happily ever afterwards well live in the isle of man said fenella on manx gold i

my uncles things i mean why now its odd your saying that  you have then as i say its odd your saying that snuffboxes theres at least four of them i cant lay my hand on anywhere four of them cried fenella that must be it were on the track lets go out in the garden and look about theres nothing there said mrs skillicorn id know if there were your uncle couldnt have buried anything in the garden without my knowing about it points of the compass are mentioned i said the first thing we need is a map of the island theres one on that desk said mrs skillicorn fenella unfolded it eagerly something fluttered out as she did so i caught it hullo i said this looks like a further clue we both went over it eagerly it appeared to be a rude kind of map there was a cross on it and a circle and a pointing arrow and directions were roughly indicated but it was hardly illuminating we studied it in silence its not very illuminating is it said fenella naturally it wants puzzling over i said we cant expect it to leap to the eye mrs skillicorn interrupted with a suggestion of supper to which we agreed thankfully and could we have some coffee said fenella lots of it very black mrs skillicorn provided us with an excellent meal and at its conclusion a large jug of coffee made its appearance and now said fenella we must get down to it the first thing i said is direction this seems to point clearly to the northeast of the island it seems so lets look at the map we studied the map attentively it all depends on how you take the thing said fenella does the cross represent the treasure or is it something like a church there really ought to be rules that would make it too easy i suppose it would why are there little lines one side of the circle and not the other i dont know are there any more maps anywhere we were sitting in the library there were several excellent maps there were also various guide books descriptive of the island there was a book on folklore there was a book on the history of the island we read them all and at last we formed a possible theory it does seem to fit said fenella at last i mean the two together is a likely conjunction which doesnt seem to occur anywhere else its worth trying anyhow i said i dont think we can do anything more tonight tomorrow first thing well hire a car and go off and try our luck its tomorrow now said fenella half past two just fancy early morning saw us on the road we had hired a car for a week arranging to drive it ourselves fenellas spirits rose as we sped along the excellent road mile after mile if only it wasnt for the other two what fun this would be she said this is where the derby was originally run wasnt it before it was changed to epsom how queer that is to think of i drew her attention to a farmhouse that must be where there is said to be a secret passage running under the sea to that island what fun i love secret passages dont you oh juan were getting quite near now im terribly excited if we should be right five minutes later we abandoned the car everythings in the right position said fenella tremulously we walked on six of them thats right now between these two have you got the compass five minutes later we were standing facing each other an incredulous joy on our faces and on my outstretched palm lay an antique snuffbox we had been successful on our return to maughold house mrs skillicorn met us with the information that two gentlemen had arrived one had departed again but the other was in the library a tall fair man with a florid face rose smilingly from an armchair as we entered the room mr faraker and miss mylecharane delighted to meet you i am your distant cousin dr fayll amusing game all this isnt it his manner was urbane and pleasant but i took an immediate dislike to him i felt that in some way the man was dangerous his pleasant manner was somehow too pleasant and his eyes never met yours fairly im afraid weve got bad news for you i said miss mylecharane and myself have already discovered the first treasure  he took it very well too bad too bad posts from here must be odd barford and i started at once we did not dare to confess the perfidy of uncle myles anyway we shall all start fair for the second round said fenella splendid what about getting down to the clues right away your excellent mrs er skillicorn holds them i believe that wouldnt be fair to mr corjeag said fenella quickly we must wait for him true true i had forgotten we must get in touch with him as quickly as possible i will see to that you two must be tired out and want to rest thereupon he took his departure ewan corjeag must have been unexpectedly difficult to find for it was not till nearly eleven oclock that night that dr fayll rang up he suggested that he and ewan should come over to maughold house at ten oclock the following morning when mrs skillicorn could hand us out the clues that will do splendidly said fenella ten oclock tomorrow we retired to bed tired but happy the following morning we were aroused by mrs skillicorn completely shaken out of her usual pessimistic calm whatever do you think she panted the house has been broken into burglars i exclaimed incredulously has anything been taken not a thing and thats the odd part of it no doubt they were after the silver but the door being locked on the outside they couldnt get any further fenella and i accompanied her to the scene of the outrage which happened to be in her own sitting room the window there had undeniably been forced yet nothing seemed to have been taken it was all rather curious i dont see what they can have been looking for said fenella its not as though there were a treasure chest hidden in the house i agreed facetiously suddenly an idea flashed into my mind i turned to mrs skillicorn the clues the clues you were to give us this morning why to be sure theyre in that top drawer she went across to it why i do declare theres nothing here theyre gone not burglars i said our esteemed relations and i remember uncle myless warning on the subject of unscrupulous dealing clearly he had known what he was talking about a dirty trick hush said fenella suddenly holding up a finger what was that the sound she had caught came plainly to our ears it was a groan and it came from outside we went to the window and leaned out there was a shrubbery growing against this side of the house and we could see nothing but the groan came again and we could see that the bushes seemed to have been disturbed and trampled we hurried down and out round the house the first thing we found was a fallen ladder showing how the thieves had reached the window a few steps further brought us to where a man was lying he was a youngish man dark and he was evidently badly injured for his head was lying in a pool of blood i knelt down beside him we must get a doctor at once im afraid hes dying the gardener was sent off hurriedly i slipped my hand into his breast pocket and brought out a pocket book on it were the initials ec ewan corjeag said fenella the mans eyes opened he said faintly fell from ladder    then lost consciousness again close by his head was a large jagged stone stained with blood its clear enough i said the ladder slipped and he fell striking his head on this stone im afraid its done for him poor fellow so you think that was it said fenella in an odd tone of voice but at that moment the doctor arrived he held out little hope of recovery ewan corjeag was moved into the house and a nurse was sent for to take charge of him nothing could be done and he would die a couple of hours later we had been sent for and were standing by his bed his eyes opened and flickered we are your cousins juan and fenella i said is there anything we can do he made a faint negative motion of the head a whisper came from his lips i bent to catch it do you want the clue im done dont let fayll do you down yes said fenella tell me something like a grin came over his face dye ken  he began then suddenly his head fell over sideways and he died i dont like it said fenella suddenly what dont you like listen juan ewan stole those clues he admits falling from the ladder then where are they weve seen all the contents of his pockets there were three sealed envelopes so mrs skillicorn says those sealed envelopes arent there what do you think then i think there was someone else there someone who jerked away the ladder so that he fell and that stone he never fell on it it was brought from some distance away ive found the mark he was deliberately bashed on the head with it but fenella thats murder yes said fenella very white its murder remember dr fayll never turned up at ten oclock this morning where is he you think hes the murderer yes you know this treasure its a lot of money juan and weve no idea where to look for him i said a pity corjeag couldnt have finished what he was going to say theres one thing might help this was in his hand she handed me a torn snapshot suppose its a clue the murderer snatched it away and never noticed hed left a corner of it behind if we were to find the other half  to do that i said we must find the second treasure lets look at this thing hm i said theres nothing much to go by that seems a kind of tower in the middle of the circle but it would be very hard to identify fenella nodded dr fayll has the important half he knows where to look weve got to find that man juan and watch him of course we wont let him see we suspect i wonder whereabouts in the island he is this minute if we only knew  my mind went back to the dying man suddenly i sat up excitedly fenella i said corjeag wasnt scotch no of course not well then dont you see what he meant i mean no i scribbled something on a piece of paper and tossed it to her whats this the name of a firm that might help us bellman and true who are they lawyers no theyre more in our line private detectives and i proceeded to explain dr fayll to see you said mrs skillicorn we looked at each other twenty four hours had elapsed we had returned from our quest successful for the second time not wishing to draw attention to ourselves we had journeyed in the snaefell a charabanc i wonder if he knows we saw him in the distance murmured fenella its extraordinary if it hadnt been for the hint that photograph gave us  hush and do be careful juan he must be simply furious at our having outwitted him in spite of everything no trace of it appeared in the doctors manner however he entered the room his urbane and charming self and i felt my faith in fenellas theory dwindling what a shocking tragedy he said poor corjeag i suppose he was well trying to steal a march on us retribution was swift well well we scarcely knew him poor fellow you must have wondered why i didnt turn up this morning as arranged i got a fake message corjeags doing i suppose it sent me off on a wild goose chase right across the island and now you two have romped home again how do you do it there was a note of really eager inquiry in his voice which did not escape me cousin ewan was fortunately able to speak just before he died said fenella i was watching the man and i could swear i saw alarm leap into his eyes at her words eh eh whats that he said he was just able to give us a clue as to the whereabouts of the treasure explained fenella oh i see i see ive been clean out of things though curiously enough i myself was in that part of the island you may have seen me strolling round we were so busy said fenella apologetically of course of course you must have run across the thing more or less by accident lucky young people arent you well whats the next programme will mrs skillicorn oblige us with the new clues but it seemed that this third set of clues had been deposited with the lawyers and we all three repaired to the lawyers office where the sealed envelopes were handed over to us the contents were simple a map with a certain area marked off on it and a paper of directions attached in  this place made history ten paces from the landmark to the east then an equal ten paces north stand there looking east two trees are in the line of vision one of them was sacred in this island draw a circle five feet from the spanish chestnut and with head bent walk round look well youll find looks as though we were going to tread on each others toes a bit today commented the doctor true to my policy of apparent friendliness i offered him a lift in our car which he accepted we had lunch at port erin and then started on our search i had debated in my own mind the reason of my uncles depositing this particular set of clues with his lawyer had he foreseen the possibility of a theft and had he determined that not more than one set of clues should fall into the thiefs possession the treasure hunt this afternoon was not without its humour the area of search was limited and we were continually in sight of each other we eyed each other suspiciously each trying to determine whether the other was farther on or had had a brain wave this is all part of uncle myless plan said fenella he wanted us to watch each other and go through all the agonies of thinking the other person was getting there come i said lets get down to it scientifically weve got one definite clue to start on in  this place made history look up the reference books weve got with us and see if we cant hunt that down once we get that  hes looking in that hedge interrupted fenella oh i cant bear it if hes got it  attend to me i said firmly theres really only one way to go about it the proper way there are so few trees on the island that it would be much simpler just to look for a chestnut tree said fenella i pass over the next hour we grew hot and despondent and all the time we were tortured with fear that fayll might be succeeding whilst we failed i remember once reading in a detective story i said how a fellow stuck a paper of writing in a bath of acid and all sorts of other words came out do you think but we havent got a bath of acid i dont think uncle myles could expect expert chemical knowledge but theres common or garden heat  we slipped round the corner of a hedge and in a minute or two i had kindled a few twigs i held the paper as close to the blaze as i dared almost at once i was rewarded by seeing characters begin to appear at the foot of the sheet there were just two words kirkhill station read out fenella just at that moment fayll came round the corner whether he had heard or not we had no means of judging he showed nothing but juan said fenella when he moved away there isnt a kirkhill station she held out the map as she spoke no i said examining it but look here and with a pencil i drew a line on it of course and somewhere on that line  exactly but i wish we knew the exact spot it was then that my second brain wave came to me we do i cried and seizing the pencil again i said look fenella uttered a cry how idiotic she cried and how marvellous what a sell really uncle myles was a most ingenious old gentleman the time had come for the last clue this the lawyer had informed us was not in his keeping it was to be posted to us on receipt of a postcard sent by him he would impart no further information nothing arrived however on the morning it should have done and fenella and i went through agonies believing that fayll had managed somehow to intercept our letter the next day however our fears were calmed and the mystery explained when we received the following illiterate scrawl dear sir or madam escuse delay but have been all sixes and sevens but i do now as mr mylecharane axed me to and send you the piece of riting wot as been in my family many long years the wot he wanted it for i do not know thanking you i am mary kerruish postmark bride i remarked now for the piece of riting handed down in my family upon a rock a sign youll see o tell me what the point of that may be well firstly a near by youll find quite suddenly the light you seek then b a house a cottage with a thatch and wall a meandering lane near by thats all its very unfair to begin with a rock said fenella there are rocks everywhere how can you tell which one has the sign on it if we could settle on the district i said it ought to be fairly easy to find the rock it must have a mark on it pointing in a certain direction and in that direction there will be something hidden which will throw light on the finding of the treasure i think youre right said fenella thats a the new clue will give us a hint where b the cottage is to be found the treasure itself is hidden down a lane alongside the cottage but clearly weve got to find a first owing to the difficulty of the initial step uncle myless last problem proved a real teaser to fenella falls the distinction of unravelling it and even then she did not accomplish it for nearly a week now and then we had come across fayll in our search of rocky districts but the area was a wide one when we finally made our discovery it was late in the evening too late i said to start off to the place indicated fenella disagreed supposing fayll finds it too she said and we wait till tomorrow and he starts off tonight how we should kick ourselves suddenly a marvellous idea occurred to me fenella i said do you still believe that fayll murdered ewan corjeag i do then i think that now weve got our chance to bring the crime home to him that man makes me shiver hes bad all through tell me advertise the fact that weve found a then start off ten to one hell follow us its a lonely place just what would suit his book hell come out in the open if we pretend to find the treasure and then and then i said hell have a little surprise it was close on midnight we had left the car some distance away and were creeping along by the side of a wall fenella had a powerful flashlight which she was using i myself carried a revolver i was taking no chances suddenly with a low cry fenella stopped look juan she cried weve got it at last for a moment i was off my guard led by instinct i whirled round but too late fayll stood six paces away and his revolver covered us both good evening he said this trick is mine youll hand over that treasure if you please would you like me also to hand over something else i asked half a snapshot torn from a dying mans hand you have the other half i think his hand wavered what are you talking about he growled the truths known i said you and corjeag were there together you pulled away the ladder and crashed his head with that stone the police are cleverer than you imagine dr fayll they know do they then by heaven ill swing for three murders instead of one drop fenella i screamed and at the same minute his revolver barked loudly we had both dropped in the heather and before he could fire again uniformed men sprang out from behind the wall where they had been hiding a moment later fayll had been handcuffed and led away i caught fenella in my arms i knew i was right she said tremulously darling i cried it was too risky he might have shot you but he didnt said fenella and we know where the treasure is do we i do see  she scribbled a word well look for it tomorrow there cant be many hiding places there i should say it was just noon when eureka said fenella softly the fourth snuffbox weve got them all uncle myles would be pleased and now  now i said we can be married and live together happily ever afterwards well live in the isle of man said fenella on manx gold i said and laughed aloud for sheer happiness

WITHIN A WALL, it was mrs lemprire who discovered the existence of jane haworth it would be of course somebody once said that mrs lemprire was easily the most hated woman in london but that i think is an exaggeration she has certainly a knack of tumbling on the one thing you wish to keep quiet about and she does it with real genius it is always an accident in this case we had been having tea in alan everards studio he gave these teas occasionally and used to stand about in corners wearing very old clothes rattling the coppers in his trouser pockets and looking profoundly miserable i do not suppose anyone will dispute everards claim to genius at this date his two most famous pictures colour and the connoisseur which belong to his early period before he became a fashionable portrait painter were purchased by the nation last year and for once the choice went unchallenged but at the date of which i speak everard was only beginning to come into his own and we were free to consider that we had discovered him it was his wife who organized these parties everards attitude to her was a peculiar one that he adored her was evident and only to be expected adoration was isobels due but he seemed always to feel himself slightly in her debt he assented to anything she wished not so much through tenderness as through an unalterable conviction that she had a right to her own way i suppose that was natural enough too when one comes to think of it for isobel loring had been really very celebrated when she came out she had been the dbutante of the season she had everything except money beauty position breeding brains nobody expected her to marry for love she wasnt that kind of girl in her second season she had three strings to her bow the heir to a dukedom a rising politician and a south african millionaire and then to everyones surprise she married alan everard a struggling young painter whom no one had ever heard of it is a tribute to her personality i think that everyone went on calling her isobel loring nobody ever alluded to her as isobel everard it would be i saw isobel loring this morning yes with her husband young everard the painter fellow people said isobel had done for herself it would i think have done for most men to be known as isobel lorings husband but everard was different isobels talent for success hadnt failed her after all alan everard painted colour i suppose everyone knows the picture a stretch of road with a trench dug down it the turned earth reddish in colour a shining length of brown glazed drainpipe and the huge navvy resting for a minute on his spade a herculean figure in stained corduroys with a scarlet neckerchief his eyes look out at you from the canvas without intelligence without hope but with a dumb unconscious pleading the eyes of a magnificent brute beast it is a flaming thing a symphony of orange and red a lot has been written about its symbolism about what it is meant to express alan everard himself says he didnt mean it to express anything he was he said nauseated by having had to look at a lot of pictures of venetian sunsets and a sudden longing for a riot of purely english colour assailed him after that everard gave the world that epic painting of a public house romance the black street with rain falling the half open door the lights and shining glasses the little foxy faced man passing through the doorway small mean insignificant with lips parted and eyes eager passing in to forget on the strength of these two pictures everard was acclaimed as a painter of working men he had his niche but he refused to stay in it his third and most brilliant work a full length portrait of sir rufus herschman the famous scientist is painted against a background of retorts and crucibles and laboratory shelves the whole has what may be called a cubist effect but the lines of perspective run strangely and now he had completed his fourth work a portrait of his wife we had been invited to see and criticize everard himself scowled and looked out of the window isobel loring moved amongst the guests talking technique with unerring accuracy we made comments we had to we praised the painting of the pink satin the treatment of that we said was really marvellous nobody had painted satin in quite that way before mrs lemprire who is one of the most intelligent art critics i know took me aside almost at once georgie she said what has he done to himself the things dead its smooth its oh its damnable portrait of a lady in pink satin i suggested exactly and yet the techniques perfect and the care theres enough work there for sixteen pictures too much work i suggested perhaps thats it if there ever was anything there hes killed it an extremely beautiful woman in a pink satin dress why not a coloured photograph why not i agreed do you suppose he knows dont you see the mans on edge it comes i daresay of mixing up sentiment and business hes put his whole soul into painting isobel because she is isobel and in sparing her hes lost her hes been too kind youve got to to destroy the flesh before you can get at the soul sometimes i nodded reflectively sir rufus herschman had not been flattered physically but everard had succeeded in putting on the canvas a personality that was unforgettable and isobels got such a very forceful personality continued mrs lemprire perhaps everard cant paint women i said perhaps not said mrs lemprire thoughtfully yes that may be the explanation and it was then with her usual genius for accuracy that she pulled out a canvas that was leaning with its face to the wall there were about eight of them stacked carelessly it was pure chance that mrs lemprire selected the one she did but as i said before these things happen with mrs lemprire ah said mrs lemprire as she turned it to the light it was unfinished a mere rough sketch the woman or girl she was not i thought more than twenty five or six was leaning forward her chin on her hand two things struck me at once the extraordinary vitality of the picture and the amazing cruelty of it everard had painted with a vindictive brush the attitude even was a cruel one it had brought out every awkwardness every sharp angle every crudity it was a study in brown brown dress brown background brown eyes wistful eager eyes eagerness was indeed the prevailing note of it mrs lemprire looked at it for some minutes in silence then she called to everard alan she said come here whos this everard came over obediently i saw the sudden flash of annoyance that he could not quite hide thats only a daub he said i dont suppose i shall ever finish it who is she said mrs lemprire everard was clearly unwilling to answer and his unwillingness was as meat and drink to mrs lemprire who always believes the worst on principle a friend of mine a miss jane haworth ive never met her here said mrs lemprire she doesnt come to these shows he paused a minute then added shes winnies godmother winnie was his little daughter aged five really said mrs lemprire where does she live battersea a flat really said mrs lemprire again and then added and what has she ever done to you to me to you to make you so ruthless oh that he laughed well you know shes not a beauty i cant make her one out of friendship can i youve done the opposite said mrs lemprire youve caught hold of every defect of hers and exaggerated it and twisted it youve tried to make her ridiculous but you havent succeeded my child that portrait if you finish it will live everard looked annoyed its not bad he said lightly for a sketch that is but of course its not a patch on isobels portrait thats far and away the best thing ive ever done he said the last words defiantly and aggressively neither of us answered far and away the best thing he repeated some of the others had drawn near us they too caught sight of the sketch there were exclamations comments the atmosphere began to brighten up it was in this way that i first heard of jane haworth later i was to meet her twice i was to hear details of her life from one of her most intimate friends i was to learn much from alan everard himself now that they are both dead i think it is time to contradict some of the stories mrs lemprire is busily spreading abroad call some of my story invention if you will it is not far from the truth when the guests had left alan everard turned the portrait of jane haworth with its face to the wall again isobel came down the room and stood beside him a success do you think she asked thoughtfully or not quite a success the portrait he asked quickly no silly the party of course the portraits a success its the best thing ive done everard declared aggressively were getting on said isobel lady charmington wants you to paint her oh lord he frowned im not a fashionable portrait painter you know you will be youll get to the top of the tree thats not the tree i want to get to the top of but alan dear thats the way to make mints of money who wants mints of money perhaps i do she said smiling at once he felt apologetic ashamed if she had not married him she could have had her mints of money and she needed it a certain amount of luxury was her proper setting weve not done so badly just lately he said wistfully no indeed but the bills are coming in rather fast bills always bills he walked up and down oh hang it i dont want to paint lady charmington he burst out rather like a petulant child isobel smiled a little she stood by the fire without moving alan stopped his restless pacing and came nearer to her what was there in her in her stillness her inertia that drew him drew him like a magnet how beautiful she was her arms like sculptured white marble the pure gold of her hair her lips red full lips he kissed them felt them fasten on his own did anything else matter what was there in isobel that soothed you that took all your cares from you she drew you into her own beautiful inertia and held you there quiet and content poppy and mandragora you drifted there on a dark lake asleep ill do lady charmington he said presently what does it matter i shall be bored but after all painters must eat theres mr pots the painter mrs pots the painters wife and miss pots the painters daughter all needing sustenance absurd boy said isobel talking of our daughter you ought to go and see jane some time she was here yesterday and said she hadnt seen you for months jane was here yes to see winnie alan brushed winnie aside did she see the picture of you yes what did she think of it she said it was splendid oh he frowned lost in thought mrs lemprire suspects you of a guilty passion for jane i think remarked isobel her nose twitched a good deal that woman said alan with deep disgust that woman what wouldnt she think what doesnt she think well i dont think said isobel smiling so go and see jane soon alan looked across at her she was sitting now on a low couch by the fire her face was half turned away the smile still lingered on her lips and at that moment he felt bewildered confused as though a mist had formed round him and suddenly parting had given him a glimpse into a strange country something said to him why does she want you to go and see jane theres a reason because with isobel there was bound to be a reason there was no impulse in isobel only calculation do you like jane he asked suddenly shes a dear said isobel yes but do you really like her of course shes so devoted to winnie by the way she wants to carry winnie off to the seaside next week you dont mind do you it will leave us free for scotland it will be extraordinarily convenient it would indeed be just that extraordinarily convenient he looked across at isobel with a sudden suspicion had she asked jane jane was so easily imposed upon isobel got up and went out of the room humming to herself oh well it didnt matter anyway he would go and see jane jane haworth lived at the top of a block of mansion flats overlooking battersea park when everard had climbed four flights of stairs and pressed the bell he felt annoyed with jane why couldnt she live somewhere more getatable when not having obtained an answer he had pressed the bell three times his annoyance had grown greater why couldnt she keep someone capable of answering the door suddenly it opened and jane herself stood in the doorway she was flushed wheres alice asked everard without any attempt at greeting well im afraid i mean shes not well today drunk you mean said everard grimly what a pity that jane was such an inveterate liar i suppose thats it said jane reluctantly let me see her he strode into the flat jane followed him with disarming meekness he found the delinquent alice in the kitchen there was no doubt whatever as to her condition he followed jane into the sitting room in grim silence youll have to get rid of that woman he said i told you so before i know you did alan but i cant do that you forget her husbands in prison where he ought to be said everard how often has that woman been drunk in the three months youve had her not so very many times three or four perhaps she gets depressed you know three or four nine or ten would be nearer the mark how does she cook rottenly is she the least assistance or comfort to you in this flat none whatever for gods sake get rid of her tomorrow morning and engage a girl who is of some use jane looked at him unhappily you wont said everard gloomily sinking into a big armchair youre such an impossibly sentimental creature whats this i hear about your taking winnie to the seaside who suggested it you or isobel jane said very quickly i did of course jane said everard if you would only learn to speak the truth i should be quite fond of you sit down and for goodness sake dont tell any more lies for at least ten minutes oh alan said jane and sat down the painter examined her critically for a minute or two mrs lemprire that woman had been quite right he had been cruel in his handling of jane jane was almost if not quite beautiful the long lines of her body were pure greek it was that eager anxiety of hers to please that made her awkward he had seized on that exaggerated it had sharpened the line of her slightly pointed chin flung her body into an ugly poise why why was it impossible for him to be five minutes in the room with jane without feeling violent irritation against her rising up in him say what you would jane was a dear but irritating he was never soothed and at peace with her as he was with isobel and yet jane was so anxious to please so willing to agree with all he said but alas so transparently unable to conceal her real feelings he looked round the room typically jane some lovely things pure gems that piece of battersea enamel for instance and there next to it an atrocity of a vase hand painted with roses he picked the latter up would you be very angry jane if i pitched this out of the window oh alan you mustnt what do you want with all this trash youve plenty of taste if you care to use it mixing things up i know alan it isnt that i dont know but people give me things that vase miss bates brought it back from margate and shes so poor and has to scrape and it must have cost her quite a lot for her you know and she thought id be so pleased i simply had to put it in a good place everard said nothing he went on looking round the room there were one or two etchings on the walls there were also a number of photographs of babies babies whatever their mothers may think do not always photograph well any of janes friends who acquired babies hurried to send photographs of them to her expecting these tokens to be cherished jane had duly cherished them whos this little horror asked everard inspecting a pudgy addition with a squint ive not seen him before its a her said jane mary carringtons new baby poor mary carrington said everard i suppose youll pretend that you like having that atrocious infant squinting at you all day janes chin shot out shes a lovely baby mary is a very old friend of mine loyal jane said everard smiling at her so isobel landed you with winnie did she well she did say you wanted to go to scotland and i jumped at it you will let me have winnie wont you ive been wondering if you would let her come to me for ages but i havent liked to ask oh you can have her but its awfully good of you then thats all right said jane happily everard lit a cigarette isobel show you the new portrait he asked rather indistinctly she did what did you think of it janes answer came quickly too quickly its perfectly splendid absolutely splendid alan sprang suddenly to his feet the hand that held the cigarette shook damn you jane dont lie to me but alan im sure it is perfectly splendid havent you learnt by now jane that i know every tone of your voice you lie to me like a hatter so as not to hurt my feelings i suppose why cant you be honest do you think i want you to tell me a thing is splendid when i know as well as you do that its not the damned things dead dead theres no life in it nothing behind nothing but surface damned smooth surface ive cheated myself all along yes even this afternoon i came along to you to find out isobel doesnt know but you know you always do know i knew youd tell me it was good youve no moral sense about that sort of thing but i can tell by the tone of your voice when i showed you romance you didnt say anything at all you held your breath and gave a sort of gasp alan    everard gave her no chance to speak jane was producing the effect upon him he knew so well strange that so gentle a creature could stir him to such furious anger you think ive lost the power perhaps he said angrily but i havent i can do work every bit as good as romance better perhaps ill show you jane haworth he fairly rushed out of the flat walking rapidly he crossed through the park and over albert bridge he was still tingling all over with irritation and baffled rage jane indeed what did she know about painting what was her opinion worth why should he care but he did care he wanted to paint something that would make jane gasp her mouth would open just a little and her cheeks would flush red she would look first at the picture and then at him she wouldnt say anything at all probably in the middle of the bridge he saw the picture he was going to paint it came to him from nowhere at all out of the blue he saw it there in the air or was it in his head a little dingy curio shop rather dark and musty looking behind the counter a jew a small jew with cunning eyes in front of him the customer a big man sleek well fed opulent bloated a great jowl on him above them on a shelf a bust of white marble the light there on the boys marble face the deathless beauty of old greece scornful unheeding of sale and barter the jew the rich collector the greek boys head he saw them all the connoisseur thats what ill call it muttered alan everard stepping off the kerb and just missing being annihilated by a passing bus yes the connoisseur ill show jane when he arrived home he passed straight into the studio isobel found him there sorting out canvases alan dont forget were dining with the marches  everard shook his head impatiently damn the marches im going to work ive got hold of something but i must get it fixed fixed at once on the canvas before it goes ring them up tell them im dead isobel looked at him thoughtfully for a moment or two and then went out she understood the art of living with a genius very thoroughly she went to the telephone and made some plausible excuse she looked round her yawning a little then she sat down at her desk and began to write dear jane many thanks for your cheque received today you are good to your godchild a hundred pounds will do all sorts of things children are a terrible expense you are so fond of winnie that i felt i was not doing wrong in coming to you for help alan like all geniuses can only work at what he wants to work at and unfortunately that doesnt always keep the pot boiling hope to see you soon yours isobel when the connoisseur was finished some months later alan invited jane to come and see it the thing was not quite as he had conceived it that was impossible to hope for but it was near enough he felt the glow of the creator he had made this thing and it was good jane did not this time tell him it was splendid the colour crept into her cheeks and her lips parted she looked at alan and he saw in her eyes that which he wished to see jane knew he walked on air he had shown jane the picture off his mind he began to notice his immediate surroundings once more winnie had benefited enormously from her fortnight at the seaside but it struck him that her clothes were very shabby he said so to isobel alan you who never notice anything but i like children to be simply dressed i hate them all fussed up theres a difference between simplicity and darns and patches isobel said nothing but she got winnie a new frock two days later alan was struggling with income tax returns his own passbook lay in front of him he was hunting through isobels desk for hers when winnie danced into the room with a disreputable doll daddy ive got a riddle can you guess it within a wall as white as milk within a curtain soft as silk bathed in a sea of crystal clear a golden apple doth appear guess what that is your mother said alan absently he was still hunting daddy winnie gave a scream of laughter its an egg why did you think it was mummy alan smiled too i wasnt really listening he said and the words sounded like mummy somehow a wall as white as milk a curtain crystal the golden apple yes it did suggest isobel to him curious things words he had found the passbook now he ordered winnie peremptorily from the room ten minutes later he looked up startled by a sharp exclamation alan hullo isobel i didnt hear you come in look here i cant make out these items in your passbook what business had you to touch my passbook he stared at her astonished she was angry he had never seen her angry before i had no idea you would mind i do mind very much indeed you have no business to touch my things alan suddenly became angry too i apologize but since i have touched your things perhaps you will explain one or two entries that puzzle me as far as i can see nearly five hundred pounds has been paid into your account this year which i cannot check where does it come from isobel had recovered her temper she sank into a chair you neednt be so solemn about it alan she said lightly it isnt the wages of sin or anything like that where did this money come from from a woman a friend of yours its not mine at all its for winnie winnie do you mean this money came from jane isobel nodded shes devoted to the child cant do enough for her yes but surely the money ought to have been invested for winnie oh it isnt that sort of thing at all its for current expenses clothes and all that alan said nothing he was thinking of winnies frocks all darns and patches your accounts overdrawn too isobel is it thats always happening to me yes but that five hundred  my dear alan ive spent it on winnie in the way that seemed best to me i can assure you jane is quite satisfied alan was not satisfied yet such was the power of isobels calm that he said nothing more after all isobel was careless in money matters she hadnt meant to use for herself money given to her for the child a receipted bill came that day addressed by a mistake to mr everard it was from a dressmaker in hanover square and was for two hundred odd pounds he gave it to isobel without a word she glanced over it smiled and said poor boy i suppose it seems an awful lot to you but one really must be more or less clothed the next day he went to see jane jane was irritating and elusive as usual he wasnt to bother winnie was her godchild women understood these things men didnt of course she didnt want winnie to have five hundred pounds worth of frocks would he please leave it to her and isobel they understood each other perfectly alan went away in a state of growing dissatisfaction he knew perfectly well that he had shirked the one question he really wished to ask he wanted to say has isobel ever asked you for money for winnie he didnt say it because he was afraid that jane might not lie well enough to deceive him but he was worried jane was poor he knew she was poor she mustnt mustnt denude herself he made up his mind to speak to isobel isobel was calm and reassuring of course she wouldnt let jane spend more than she could afford a month later jane died it was influenza followed by pneumonia she made alan everard her executor and left all she had to winnie but it wasnt very much it was alans task to go through janes papers she left a record there that was clear to follow numerous evidences of acts of kindness begging letters grateful letters and lastly he found her diary with it was a scrap of paper to be read after my death by alan everard he has often reproached me with not speaking the truth the truth is all here so he came to know at last finding the one place where jane had dared to be honest it was a record very simple and unforced of her love for him there was very little sentiment about it no fine language but there was no blinking of facts i know you are often irritated by me she had written everything i do or say seems to make you angry sometimes i do not know why this should be for i try so hard to please you but i do believe all the same that i mean something real to you one isnt angry with the people who dont count it was not janes fault that alan found other matters jane was loyal but she was also untidy she filled her drawers too full she had shortly before her death burnt carefully all isobels letters the one alan found was wedged behind a drawer when he had read it the meaning of certain cabalistic signs on the counterfoils of janes chequebook became clear to him in this particular letter isobel had hardly troubled to keep up the pretence of the money being required for winnie alan sat in front of the desk staring with unseeing eyes out of the window for a long time finally he slipped the chequebook into his pocket and left the flat he walked back to chelsea conscious of an anger that grew rapidly stronger isobel was out when he got back and he was sorry he had so clearly in his mind what he wanted to say instead he went up to the studio and pulled out the unfinished portrait of jane he set it on an easel near the portrait of isobel in pink satin the lemprire woman had been right there was life in janes portrait he looked at her the eager eyes the beauty that he had tried so unsuccessfully to deny her that was jane the aliveness more than anything else was jane she was he thought the most alive person he had ever met so much so that even now he could not think of her as dead and he thought of his other pictures colour romance sir rufus herschman they had all in a way been pictures of jane she had kindled the spark for each one of them had sent him away fuming and fretting to show her and now jane was dead would he ever paint a picture a real picture again he looked again at the eager face on the canvas perhaps jane wasnt very far away a sound made him wheel round isobel had come into the studio she was dressed for dinner in a straight white gown that showed up the pure gold of her hair she stopped dead and checked the words on her lips eyeing him warily she went over to the divan and sat down she had every appearance of calm alan took the chequebook from his pocket ive been going through janes papers yes he tried to imitate her calm to keep his voice from shaking for the last four years shes been supplying you with money yes for winnie no not for winnie shouted everard you pretended both of you that it was for winnie but you both knew that that wasnt so do you realize that jane has been selling her securities living from hand to mouth to supply you with clothes clothes that you didnt really need isobel never took her eyes from his face she settled her body more comfortably on the cushions as a white persian cat might do i cant help it if jane denuded herself more than she should have done she said i supposed she could afford the money she was always crazy about you i could see that of course some wives would have kicked up a fuss about the way you were always rushing off to see her and spending hours there i didnt no said alan very white in the face you made her pay instead you are saying very offensive things alan be careful arent they true why did you find it so easy to get money out of jane not for love of me certainly it must have been for love of you thats just what it was said alan simply she paid for my freedom freedom to work in my own way so long as you had a sufficiency of money youd leave me alone not badger me to paint a crowd of awful women isobel said nothing well cried alan angrily her quiescence infuriated him isobel was looking at the floor presently she raised her head and said quietly come here alan she touched the divan at her side uneasily unwillingly he came and sat there not looking at her but he knew that he was afraid alan said isobel presently well he was irritable nervous all that you say may be true it doesnt matter im like that i want things clothes money you janes dead alan what do you mean janes dead you belong to me altogether now you never did before not quite he looked at her saw the light in her eyes acquisitive possessive was revolted yet fascinated now you shall be all mine he understood isobel then as he had never understood her before you want me as a slave im to paint what you tell me to paint live as you tell me to live be dragged at your chariot wheels put it like that if you please what are words he felt her arms round his neck white smooth firm as a wall words danced through his brain a wall as white as milk already he was inside the wall could he still escape did he want to escape he heard her voice close against his ear poppy and mandragora what else is there to live for isnt this enough love happiness success love  the wall was growing up all round him now the curtain soft as silk the curtain wrapping him round stifling him a little but so soft so sweet now they were drifting together at peace out on the crystal sea the wall was very high now shutting out all those other things those dangerous disturbing things that hurt that always hurt out on the sea of crystal the golden apple between their hands the light faded from janes picture eight ,1925,558,7468,5835,87.94475488570086,10.456989247311828,1.2798628963153384, it was mrs lemprire who discovered the existence of jane haworth it would be of course somebody once said that mrs lemprire was easily the most hated woman in london but that i think is an exaggeration she has certainly a knack of tumbling on the one thing you wish to keep quiet about and she does it with real genius it is always an accident in this case we had been having tea in alan everards studio he gave these teas occasionally and used to stand about in corners wearing very old clothes rattling the coppers in his trouser pockets and looking profoundly miserable i do not suppose anyone will dispute everards claim to genius at this date his two most famous pictures colour and the connoisseur which belong to his early period before he became a fashionable portrait painter were purchased by the nation last year and for once the choice went unchallenged but at the date of which i speak everard was only beginning to come into his own and we were free to consider that we had discovered him it was his wife who organized these parties everards attitude to her was a peculiar one that he adored her was evident and only to be expected adoration was isobels due but he seemed always to feel himself slightly in her debt he assented to anything she wished not so much through tenderness as through an unalterable conviction that she had a right to her own way i suppose that was natural enough too when one comes to think of it for isobel loring had been really very celebrated when she came out she had been the dbutante of the season she had everything except money beauty position breeding brains nobody expected her to marry for love she wasnt that kind of girl in her second season she had three strings to her bow the heir to a dukedom a rising politician and a south african millionaire and then to everyones surprise she married alan everard a struggling young painter whom no one had ever heard of it is a tribute to her personality i think that everyone went on calling her isobel loring nobody ever alluded to her as isobel everard it would be i saw isobel loring this morning yes with her husband young everard the painter fellow people said isobel had done for herself it would i think have done for most men to be known as isobel lorings husband but everard was different isobels talent for success hadnt failed her after all alan everard painted colour i suppose everyone knows the picture a stretch of road with a trench dug down it the turned earth reddish in colour a shining length of brown glazed drainpipe and the huge navvy resting for a minute on his spade a herculean figure in stained corduroys with a scarlet neckerchief his eyes look out at you from the canvas without intelligence without hope but with a dumb unconscious pleading the eyes of a magnificent brute beast it is a flaming thing a symphony of orange and red a lot has been written about its symbolism about what it is meant to express alan everard himself says he didnt mean it to express anything he was he said nauseated by having had to look at a lot of pictures of venetian sunsets and a sudden longing for a riot of purely english colour assailed him after that everard gave the world that epic painting of a public house romance the black street with rain falling the half open door the lights and shining glasses the little foxy faced man passing through the doorway small mean insignificant with lips parted and eyes eager passing in to forget on the strength of these two pictures everard was acclaimed as a painter of working men he had his niche but he refused to stay in it his third and most brilliant work a full length portrait of sir rufus herschman the famous scientist is painted against a background of retorts and crucibles and laboratory shelves the whole has what may be called a cubist effect but the lines of perspective run strangely and now he had completed his fourth work a portrait of his wife we had been invited to see and criticize everard himself scowled and looked out of the window isobel loring moved amongst the guests talking technique with unerring accuracy we made comments we had to we praised the painting of the pink satin the treatment of that we said was really marvellous nobody had painted satin in quite that way before mrs lemprire who is one of the most intelligent art critics i know took me aside almost at once georgie she said what has he done to himself the things dead its smooth its oh its damnable portrait of a lady in pink satin i suggested exactly and yet the techniques perfect and the care theres enough work there for sixteen pictures too much work i suggested perhaps thats it if there ever was anything there hes killed it an extremely beautiful woman in a pink satin dress why not a coloured photograph why not i agreed do you suppose he knows dont you see the mans on edge it comes i daresay of mixing up sentiment and business hes put his whole soul into painting isobel because she is isobel and in sparing her hes lost her hes been too kind youve got to to destroy the flesh before you can get at the soul sometimes i nodded reflectively sir rufus herschman had not been flattered physically but everard had succeeded in putting on the canvas a personality that was unforgettable and isobels got such a very forceful personality continued mrs lemprire perhaps everard cant paint women i said perhaps not said mrs lemprire thoughtfully yes that may be the explanation and it was then with her usual genius for accuracy that she pulled out a canvas that was leaning with its face to the wall there were about eight of them stacked carelessly it was pure chance that mrs lemprire selected the one she did but as i said before these things happen with mrs lemprire ah said mrs lemprire as she turned it to the light it was unfinished a mere rough sketch the woman or girl she was not i thought more than twenty five or six was leaning forward her chin on her hand two things struck me at once the extraordinary vitality of the picture and the amazing cruelty of it everard had painted with a vindictive brush the attitude even was a cruel one it had brought out every awkwardness every sharp angle every crudity it was a study in brown brown dress brown background brown eyes wistful eager eyes eagerness was indeed the prevailing note of it mrs lemprire looked at it for some minutes in silence then she called to everard alan she said come here whos this everard came over obediently i saw the sudden flash of annoyance that he could not quite hide thats only a daub he said i dont suppose i shall ever finish it who is she said mrs lemprire everard was clearly unwilling to answer and his unwillingness was as meat and drink to mrs lemprire who always believes the worst on principle a friend of mine a miss jane haworth ive never met her here said mrs lemprire she doesnt come to these shows he paused a minute then added shes winnies godmother winnie was his little daughter aged five really said mrs lemprire where does she live battersea a flat really said mrs lemprire again and then added and what has she ever done to you to me to you to make you so ruthless oh that he laughed well you know shes not a beauty i cant make her one out of friendship can i youve done the opposite said mrs lemprire youve caught hold of every defect of hers and exaggerated it and twisted it youve tried to make her ridiculous but you havent succeeded my child that portrait if you finish it will live everard looked annoyed its not bad he said lightly for a sketch that is but of course its not a patch on isobels portrait thats far and away the best thing ive ever done he said the last words defiantly and aggressively neither of us answered far and away the best thing he repeated some of the others had drawn near us they too caught sight of the sketch there were exclamations comments the atmosphere began to brighten up it was in this way that i first heard of jane haworth later i was to meet her twice i was to hear details of her life from one of her most intimate friends i was to learn much from alan everard himself now that they are both dead i think it is time to contradict some of the stories mrs lemprire is busily spreading abroad call some of my story invention if you will it is not far from the truth when the guests had left alan everard turned the portrait of jane haworth with its face to the wall again isobel came down the room and stood beside him a success do you think she asked thoughtfully or not quite a success the portrait he asked quickly no silly the party of course the portraits a success its the best thing ive done everard declared aggressively were getting on said isobel lady charmington wants you to paint her oh lord he frowned im not a fashionable portrait painter you know you will be youll get to the top of the tree thats not the tree i want to get to the top of but alan dear thats the way to make mints of money who wants mints of money perhaps i do she said smiling at once he felt apologetic ashamed if she had not married him she could have had her mints of money and she needed it a certain amount of luxury was her proper setting weve not done so badly just lately he said wistfully no indeed but the bills are coming in rather fast bills always bills he walked up and down oh hang it i dont want to paint lady charmington he burst out rather like a petulant child isobel smiled a little she stood by the fire without moving alan stopped his restless pacing and came nearer to her what was there in her in her stillness her inertia that drew him drew him like a magnet how beautiful she was her arms like sculptured white marble the pure gold of her hair her lips red full lips he kissed them felt them fasten on his own did anything else matter what was there in isobel that soothed you that took all your cares from you she drew you into her own beautiful inertia and held you there quiet and content poppy and mandragora you drifted there on a dark lake asleep ill do lady charmington he said presently what does it matter i shall be bored but after all painters must eat theres mr pots the painter mrs pots the painters wife and miss pots the painters daughter all needing sustenance absurd boy said isobel talking of our daughter you ought to go and see jane some time she was here yesterday and said she hadnt seen you for months jane was here yes to see winnie alan brushed winnie aside did she see the picture of you yes what did she think of it she said it was splendid oh he frowned lost in thought mrs lemprire suspects you of a guilty passion for jane i think remarked isobel her nose twitched a good deal that woman said alan with deep disgust that woman what wouldnt she think what doesnt she think well i dont think said isobel smiling so go and see jane soon alan looked across at her she was sitting now on a low couch by the fire her face was half turned away the smile still lingered on her lips and at that moment he felt bewildered confused as though a mist had formed round him and suddenly parting had given him a glimpse into a strange country something said to him why does she want you to go and see jane theres a reason because with isobel there was bound to be a reason there was no impulse in isobel only calculation do you like jane he asked suddenly shes a dear said isobel yes but do you really like her of course shes so devoted to winnie by the way she wants to carry winnie off to the seaside next week you dont mind do you it will leave us free for scotland it will be extraordinarily convenient it would indeed be just that extraordinarily convenient he looked across at isobel with a sudden suspicion had she asked jane jane was so easily imposed upon isobel got up and went out of the room humming to herself oh well it didnt matter anyway he would go and see jane jane haworth lived at the top of a block of mansion flats overlooking battersea park when everard had climbed four flights of stairs and pressed the bell he felt annoyed with jane why couldnt she live somewhere more getatable when not having obtained an answer he had pressed the bell three times his annoyance had grown greater why couldnt she keep someone capable of answering the door suddenly it opened and jane herself stood in the doorway she was flushed wheres alice asked everard without any attempt at greeting well im afraid i mean shes not well today drunk you mean said everard grimly what a pity that jane was such an inveterate liar i suppose thats it said jane reluctantly let me see her he strode into the flat jane followed him with disarming meekness he found the delinquent alice in the kitchen there was no doubt whatever as to her condition he followed jane into the sitting room in grim silence youll have to get rid of that woman he said i told you so before i know you did alan but i cant do that you forget her husbands in prison where he ought to be said everard how often has that woman been drunk in the three months youve had her not so very many times three or four perhaps she gets depressed you know three or four nine or ten would be nearer the mark how does she cook rottenly is she the least assistance or comfort to you in this flat none whatever for gods sake get rid of her tomorrow morning and engage a girl who is of some use jane looked at him unhappily you wont said everard gloomily sinking into a big armchair youre such an impossibly sentimental creature whats this i hear about your taking winnie to the seaside who suggested it you or isobel jane said very quickly i did of course jane said everard if you would only learn to speak the truth i should be quite fond of you sit down and for goodness sake dont tell any more lies for at least ten minutes oh alan said jane and sat down the painter examined her critically for a minute or two mrs lemprire that woman had been quite right he had been cruel in his handling of jane jane was almost if not quite beautiful the long lines of her body were pure greek it was that eager anxiety of hers to please that made her awkward he had seized on that exaggerated it had sharpened the line of her slightly pointed chin flung her body into an ugly poise why why was it impossible for him to be five minutes in the room with jane without feeling violent irritation against her rising up in him say what you would jane was a dear but irritating he was never soothed and at peace with her as he was with isobel and yet jane was so anxious to please so willing to agree with all he said but alas so transparently unable to conceal her real feelings he looked round the room typically jane some lovely things pure gems that piece of battersea enamel for instance and there next to it an atrocity of a vase hand painted with roses he picked the latter up would you be very angry jane if i pitched this out of the window oh alan you mustnt what do you want with all this trash youve plenty of taste if you care to use it mixing things up i know alan it isnt that i dont know but people give me things that vase miss bates brought it back from margate and shes so poor and has to scrape and it must have cost her quite a lot for her you know and she thought id be so pleased i simply had to put it in a good place everard said nothing he went on looking round the room there were one or two etchings on the walls there were also a number of photographs of babies babies whatever their mothers may think do not always photograph well any of janes friends who acquired babies hurried to send photographs of them to her expecting these tokens to be cherished jane had duly cherished them whos this little horror asked everard inspecting a pudgy addition with a squint ive not seen him before its a her said jane mary carringtons new baby poor mary carrington said everard i suppose youll pretend that you like having that atrocious infant squinting at you all day janes chin shot out shes a lovely baby mary is a very old friend of mine loyal jane said everard smiling at her so isobel landed you with winnie did she well she did say you wanted to go to scotland and i jumped at it you will let me have winnie wont you ive been wondering if you would let her come to me for ages but i havent liked to ask oh you can have her but its awfully good of you then thats all right said jane happily everard lit a cigarette isobel show you the new portrait he asked rather indistinctly she did what did you think of it janes answer came quickly too quickly its perfectly splendid absolutely splendid alan sprang suddenly to his feet the hand that held the cigarette shook damn you jane dont lie to me but alan im sure it is perfectly splendid havent you learnt by now jane that i know every tone of your voice you lie to me like a hatter so as not to hurt my feelings i suppose why cant you be honest do you think i want you to tell me a thing is splendid when i know as well as you do that its not the damned things dead dead theres no life in it nothing behind nothing but surface damned smooth surface ive cheated myself all along yes even this afternoon i came along to you to find out isobel doesnt know but you know you always do know i knew youd tell me it was good youve no moral sense about that sort of thing but i can tell by the tone of your voice when i showed you romance you didnt say anything at all you held your breath and gave a sort of gasp alan    everard gave her no chance to speak jane was producing the effect upon him he knew so well strange that so gentle a creature could stir him to such furious anger you think ive lost the power perhaps he said angrily but i havent i can do work every bit as good as romance better perhaps ill show you jane haworth he fairly rushed out of the flat walking rapidly he crossed through the park and over albert bridge he was still tingling all over with irritation and baffled rage jane indeed what did she know about painting what was her opinion worth why should he care but he did care he wanted to paint something that would make jane gasp her mouth would open just a little and her cheeks would flush red she would look first at the picture and then at him she wouldnt say anything at all probably in the middle of the bridge he saw the picture he was going to paint it came to him from nowhere at all out of the blue he saw it there in the air or was it in his head a little dingy curio shop rather dark and musty looking behind the counter a jew a small jew with cunning eyes in front of him the customer a big man sleek well fed opulent bloated a great jowl on him above them on a shelf a bust of white marble the light there on the boys marble face the deathless beauty of old greece scornful unheeding of sale and barter the jew the rich collector the greek boys head he saw them all the connoisseur thats what ill call it muttered alan everard stepping off the kerb and just missing being annihilated by a passing bus yes the connoisseur ill show jane when he arrived home he passed straight into the studio isobel found him there sorting out canvases alan dont forget were dining with the marches  everard shook his head impatiently damn the marches im going to work ive got hold of something but i must get it fixed fixed at once on the canvas before it goes ring them up tell them im dead isobel looked at him thoughtfully for a moment or two and then went out she understood the art of living with a genius very thoroughly she went to the telephone and made some plausible excuse she looked round her yawning a little then she sat down at her desk and began to write dear jane many thanks for your cheque received today you are good to your godchild a hundred pounds will do all sorts of things children are a terrible expense you are so fond of winnie that i felt i was not doing wrong in coming to you for help alan like all geniuses can only work at what he wants to work at and unfortunately that doesnt always keep the pot boiling hope to see you soon yours isobel when the connoisseur was finished some months later alan invited jane to come and see it the thing was not quite as he had conceived it that was impossible to hope for but it was near enough he felt the glow of the creator he had made this thing and it was good jane did not this time tell him it was splendid the colour crept into her cheeks and her lips parted she looked at alan and he saw in her eyes that which he wished to see jane knew he walked on air he had shown jane the picture off his mind he began to notice his immediate surroundings once more winnie had benefited enormously from her fortnight at the seaside but it struck him that her clothes were very shabby he said so to isobel alan you who never notice anything but i like children to be simply dressed i hate them all fussed up theres a difference between simplicity and darns and patches isobel said nothing but she got winnie a new frock two days later alan was struggling with income tax returns his own passbook lay in front of him he was hunting through isobels desk for hers when winnie danced into the room with a disreputable doll daddy ive got a riddle can you guess it within a wall as white as milk within a curtain soft as silk bathed in a sea of crystal clear a golden apple doth appear guess what that is your mother said alan absently he was still hunting daddy winnie gave a scream of laughter its an egg why did you think it was mummy alan smiled too i wasnt really listening he said and the words sounded like mummy somehow a wall as white as milk a curtain crystal the golden apple yes it did suggest isobel to him curious things words he had found the passbook now he ordered winnie peremptorily from the room ten minutes later he looked up startled by a sharp exclamation alan hullo isobel i didnt hear you come in look here i cant make out these items in your passbook what business had you to touch my passbook he stared at her astonished she was angry he had never seen her angry before i had no idea you would mind i do mind very much indeed you have no business to touch my things alan suddenly became angry too i apologize but since i have touched your things perhaps you will explain one or two entries that puzzle me as far as i can see nearly five hundred pounds has been paid into your account this year which i cannot check where does it come from isobel had recovered her temper she sank into a chair you neednt be so solemn about it alan she said lightly it isnt the wages of sin or anything like that where did this money come from from a woman a friend of yours its not mine at all its for winnie winnie do you mean this money came from jane isobel nodded shes devoted to the child cant do enough for her yes but surely the money ought to have been invested for winnie oh it isnt that sort of thing at all its for current expenses clothes and all that alan said nothing he was thinking of winnies frocks all darns and patches your accounts overdrawn too isobel is it thats always happening to me yes but that five hundred  my dear alan ive spent it on winnie in the way that seemed best to me i can assure you jane is quite satisfied alan was not satisfied yet such was the power of isobels calm that he said nothing more after all isobel was careless in money matters she hadnt meant to use for herself money given to her for the child a receipted bill came that day addressed by a mistake to mr everard it was from a dressmaker in hanover square and was for two hundred odd pounds he gave it to isobel without a word she glanced over it smiled and said poor boy i suppose it seems an awful lot to you but one really must be more or less clothed the next day he went to see jane jane was irritating and elusive as usual he wasnt to bother winnie was her godchild women understood these things men didnt of course she didnt want winnie to have five hundred pounds worth of frocks would he please leave it to her and isobel they understood each other perfectly alan went away in a state of growing dissatisfaction he knew perfectly well that he had shirked the one question he really wished to ask he wanted to say has isobel ever asked you for money for winnie he didnt say it because he was afraid that jane might not lie well enough to deceive him but he was worried jane was poor he knew she was poor she mustnt mustnt denude herself he made up his mind to speak to isobel isobel was calm and reassuring of course she wouldnt let jane spend more than she could afford a month later jane died it was influenza followed by pneumonia she made alan everard her executor and left all she had to winnie but it wasnt very much it was alans task to go through janes papers she left a record there that was clear to follow numerous evidences of acts of kindness begging letters grateful letters and lastly he found her diary with it was a scrap of paper to be read after my death by alan everard he has often reproached me with not speaking the truth the truth is all here so he came to know at last finding the one place where jane had dared to be honest it was a record very simple and unforced of her love for him there was very little sentiment about it no fine language but there was no blinking of facts i know you are often irritated by me she had written everything i do or say seems to make you angry sometimes i do not know why this should be for i try so hard to please you but i do believe all the same that i mean something real to you one isnt angry with the people who dont count it was not janes fault that alan found other matters jane was loyal but she was also untidy she filled her drawers too full she had shortly before her death burnt carefully all isobels letters the one alan found was wedged behind a drawer when he had read it the meaning of certain cabalistic signs on the counterfoils of janes chequebook became clear to him in this particular letter isobel had hardly troubled to keep up the pretence of the money being required for winnie alan sat in front of the desk staring with unseeing eyes out of the window for a long time finally he slipped the chequebook into his pocket and left the flat he walked back to chelsea conscious of an anger that grew rapidly stronger isobel was out when he got back and he was sorry he had so clearly in his mind what he wanted to say instead he went up to the studio and pulled out the unfinished portrait of jane he set it on an easel near the portrait of isobel in pink satin the lemprire woman had been right there was life in janes portrait he looked at her the eager eyes the beauty that he had tried so unsuccessfully to deny her that was jane the aliveness more than anything else was jane she was he thought the most alive person he had ever met so much so that even now he could not think of her as dead and he thought of his other pictures colour romance sir rufus herschman they had all in a way been pictures of jane she had kindled the spark for each one of them had sent him away fuming and fretting to show her and now jane was dead would he ever paint a picture a real picture again he looked again at the eager face on the canvas perhaps jane wasnt very far away a sound made him wheel round isobel had come into the studio she was dressed for dinner in a straight white gown that showed up the pure gold of her hair she stopped dead and checked the words on her lips eyeing him warily she went over to the divan and sat down she had every appearance of calm alan took the chequebook from his pocket ive been going through janes papers yes he tried to imitate her calm to keep his voice from shaking for the last four years shes been supplying you with money yes for winnie no not for winnie shouted everard you pretended both of you that it was for winnie but you both knew that that wasnt so do you realize that jane has been selling her securities living from hand to mouth to supply you with clothes clothes that you didnt really need isobel never took her eyes from his face she settled her body more comfortably on the cushions as a white persian cat might do i cant help it if jane denuded herself more than she should have done she said i supposed she could afford the money she was always crazy about you i could see that of course some wives would have kicked up a fuss about the way you were always rushing off to see her and spending hours there i didnt no said alan very white in the face you made her pay instead you are saying very offensive things alan be careful arent they true why did you find it so easy to get money out of jane not for love of me certainly it must have been for love of you thats just what it was said alan simply she paid for my freedom freedom to work in my own way so long as you had a sufficiency of money youd leave me alone not badger me to paint a crowd of awful women isobel said nothing well cried alan angrily her quiescence infuriated him isobel was looking at the floor presently she raised her head and said quietly come here alan she touched the divan at her side uneasily unwillingly he came and sat there not looking at her but he knew that he was afraid alan said isobel presently well he was irritable nervous all that you say may be true it doesnt matter im like that i want things clothes money you janes dead alan what do you mean janes dead you belong to me altogether now you never did before not quite he looked at her saw the light in her eyes acquisitive possessive was revolted yet fascinated now you shall be all mine he understood isobel then as he had never understood her before you want me as a slave im to paint what you tell me to paint live as you tell me to live be dragged at your chariot wheels put it like that if you please what are words he felt her arms round his neck white smooth firm as a wall words danced through his brain a wall as white as milk already he was inside the wall could he still escape did he want to escape he heard her voice close against his ear poppy and mandragora what else is there to live for isnt this enough love happiness success love  the wall was growing up all round him now the curtain soft as silk the curtain wrapping him round stifling him a little but so soft so sweet now they were drifting together at peace out on the crystal sea the wall was very high now shutting out all those other things those dangerous disturbing things that hurt that always hurt out on the sea of crystal the golden apple between their hands the light faded from janes picture eight

THE MYSTERY OF THE SPANISH CHEST, punctual to the moment as always hercule poirot entered the small room where miss lemon his efficient secretary awaited her instructions for the day at first sight miss lemon seemed to be composed entirely of angles thus satisfying poirots demand for symmetry not that where women were concerned hercule poirot carried his passion for geometrical precision so far he was on the contrary old fashioned he had a continental prejudice for curves it might be said for voluptuous curves he liked women to be women he liked them lush highly coloured exotic there had been a certain russian countess but that was long ago now a folly of earlier days but miss lemon he had never considered as a woman she was a human machine an instrument of precision her efficiency was terrific she was forty eight years of age and was fortunate enough to have no imagination whatever good morning miss lemon good morning m poirot poirot sat down and miss lemon placed before him the mornings mail neatly arranged in categories she resumed her seat and sat with pad and pencil at the ready but there was to be this morning a slight change in routine poirot had brought in with him the morning newspaper and his eyes were scanning it with interest the headlines were big and bold spanish chest mystery latest developments you have read the morning papers i presume miss lemon yes m poirot the news from geneva is not very good poirot waved away the news from geneva in a comprehensive sweep of the arm a spanish chest he mused can you tell me miss lemon what exactly is a spanish chest i suppose m poirot that it is a chest that came originally from spain one might reasonably suppose so you have then no expert knowledge they are usually of the elizabethan period i believe large and with a good deal of brass decoration on them they look very nice when well kept and polished my sister bought one at a sale she keeps household linen in it it looks very nice i am sure that in the house of any sister of yours all the furniture would be well kept said poirot bowing gracefully miss lemon replied sadly that servants did not seem to know what elbow grease was nowadays poirot looked a little puzzled but decided not to inquire into the inward meaning of the mysterious phrase elbow grease he looked down again at the newspaper conning over the names major rich mr and mrs clayton commander mclaren mr and mrs spence names nothing but names to him yet all possessed of human personalities hating loving fearing a drama this in which he hercule poirot had no part and he would have liked to have a part in it six people at an evening party in a room with a big spanish chest against the wall six people five of them talking eating a buffet supper putting records on the gramophone dancing and the sixth dead in the spanish chest    ah thought poirot how my dear friend hastings would have enjoyed this what romantic flights of imagination he would have had what ineptitudes he would have uttered ah ce cher hastings at this moment today i miss him    instead  he sighed and looked at miss lemon miss lemon intelligently perceiving that poirot was in no mood to dictate letters had uncovered her typewriter and was awaiting her moment to get on with certain arrears of work nothing could have interested her less than sinister spanish chests containing dead bodies poirot sighed and looked down at a photographed face reproductions in newsprint were never very good and this was decidedly smudgy but what a face mrs clayton the wife of the murdered man    on an impulse he thrust the paper at miss lemon look he demanded look at that face miss lemon looked at it obediently without emotion what do you think of her miss lemon that is mrs clayton miss lemon took the paper glanced casually at the picture and remarked shes a little like the wife of our bank manager when we lived at croydon heath interesting said poirot recount to me if you will be so kind the history of your bank managers wife well its not really a very pleasant story m poirot it was in my mind that it might not be continue there was a good deal of talk about mrs adams and a young artist then mr adams shot himself but mrs adams wouldnt marry the other man and he took some kind of poison but they pulled him through all right and finally mrs adams married a young solicitor i believe there was more trouble after that only of course wed left croydon heath by then so i didnt hear very much more about it hercule poirot nodded gravely she was beautiful well not really what youd call beautiful but there seemed to be something about her  exactly what is that something that they possess the sirens of this world the helens of troy the cleopatras  miss lemon inserted a piece of paper vigorously into her typewriter really m poirot ive never thought about it it seems all very silly to me if people would just go on with their jobs and didnt think about such things it would be much better having thus disposed of human frailty and passion miss lemon let her fingers hover over the keys of the typewriter waiting impatiently to be allowed to begin her work that is your view said poirot and at this moment it is your desire that you should be allowed to get on with your job but your job miss lemon is not only to take down my letters to file my papers to deal with my telephone calls to typewrite my letters all these things you do admirably but me i deal not only with documents but with human beings and there too i need assistance certainly m poirot said miss lemon patiently what is it you want me to do this case interests me i should be glad if you would make a study of this mornings report of it in all the papers and also of any additional reports in the evening papers make me a prcis of the facts very good m poirot poirot withdrew to his sitting room a rueful smile on his face it is indeed the irony he said to himself that after my dear friend hastings i should have miss lemon what greater contrast can one imagine ce cher hastings how he would have enjoyed himself how he would have walked up and down talking about it putting the most romantic construction on every incident believing as gospel truth every word the papers have printed about it and my poor miss lemon what i have asked her to do she will not enjoy at all miss lemon came to him in due course with a typewritten sheet ive got the information you wanted m poirot im afraid though it cant be regarded as reliable the papers vary a good deal in their accounts i shouldnt like to guarantee that the facts as stated are more than sixty per cent accurate that is probably a conservative estimate murmured poirot thank you miss lemon for the trouble you have taken the facts were sensational but clear enough major charles rich a well to do bachelor had given an evening party to a few of his friends at his apartment these friends consisted of mr and mrs clayton mr and mrs spence and a commander mclaren commander mclaren was a very old friend of both rich and the claytons mr and mrs spence a younger couple were fairly recent acquaintances arnold clayton was in the treasury jeremy spence was a junior civil servant major rich was forty eight arnold clayton was fifty five commander mclaren was forty six jeremy spence was thirty seven mrs clayton was said to be some years younger than her husband one person was unable to attend the party at the last moment mr clayton was called away to scotland on urgent business and was supposed to have left kings cross by the  train the party proceeded as such parties do everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves it was neither a wild party nor a drunken one it broke up about  the four guests left together and shared a taxi commander mclaren was dropped first at his club and then the spences dropped margharita clayton at cardigan gardens just off sloane street and went on themselves to their house in chelsea the gruesome discovery was made on the following morning by major richs manservant william burgess the latter did not live in he arrived early so as to clear up the sitting room before calling major rich with his early morning tea it was whilst clearing up that burgess was startled to find a big stain discolouring the light coloured rug on which stood the spanish chest it seemed to have seeped through from the chest and the valet immediately lifted up the lid of the chest and looked inside he was horrified to find there the body of mr clayton stabbed through the neck obeying his first impulse burgess rushed out into the street and fetched the nearest policeman such were the bald facts of the case but there were further details the police had immediately broken the news to mrs clayton who had been completely prostrated she had seen her husband for the last time at a little after six oclock on the evening before he had come home much annoyed having been summoned to scotland on urgent business in connection with some property that he owned he had urged his wife to go to the party without him mr clayton had then called in at his and commander mclarens club had had a drink with his friend and had explained the position he had then said looking at his watch that he had just time on his way to kings cross to call in on major rich and explain he had already tried to telephone him but the line had seemed to be out of order according to william burgess mr clayton arrived at the flat at about  major rich was out but was due to return any moment so burgess suggested that mr clayton should come in and wait clayton said he had no time but would come in and write a note he explained that he was on his way to catch a train at kings cross the valet showed him into the sitting room and himself returned to the kitchen where he was engaged in the preparation of canaps for the party the valet did not hear his master return but about ten minutes later major rich looked into the kitchen and told burgess to hurry out and get some turkish cigarettes which were mrs spences favourite smoking the valet did so and brought them to his master in the sitting room mr clayton was not there but the valet naturally thought he had already left to catch his train major richs story was short and simple mr clayton was not in the flat when he himself came in and he had no idea that he had been there no note had been left for him and the first he heard of mr claytons journey to scotland was when mrs clayton and the others arrived there were two additional items in the evening papers mrs clayton who was prostrated with shock had left her flat in cardigan gardens and was believed to be staying with friends the second item was in the stop press major charles rich had been charged with the murder of arnold clayton and had been taken into custody so that is that said poirot looking up at miss lemon the arrest of major rich was to be expected but what a remarkable case what a very remarkable case do you not think so i suppose such things do happen m poirot said miss lemon without interest oh certainly they happen every day or nearly every day but usually they are quite understandable though distressing it is certainly a very unpleasant business to be stabbed to death and stowed away in a spanish chest is certainly unpleasant for the victim supremely so but when i say this is a remarkable case i refer to the remarkable behaviour of major rich miss lemon said with faint distaste there seems to be a suggestion that major rich and mrs clayton were very close friends    it was a suggestion and not a proved fact so i did not include it that was very correct of you but it is an inference that leaps to the eye is that all you have to say miss lemon looked blank poirot sighed and missed the rich colourful imagination of his friend hastings discussing a case with miss lemon was uphill work consider for a moment this major rich he is in love with mrs clayton granted    he wants to dispose of her husband that too we grant though if mrs clayton is in love with him and they are having the affair together where is the urgency it is perhaps that mr clayton will not give his wife the divorce but it is not of all this that i talk major rich he is a retired soldier and it is said sometimes that soldiers are not brainy but tout de mme this major rich is he can he be a complete imbecile miss lemon did not reply she took this to be a purely rhetorical question well demanded poirot what do you think about it all what do i think miss lemon was startled mais oui you miss lemon adjusted her mind to the strain put upon it she was not given to mental speculation of any kind unless asked for it in such leisure moments as she had her mind was filled with the details of a superlatively perfect filing system it was her only mental recreation well  she began and paused tell me just what happened what you think happened on that evening mr clayton is in the sitting room writing a note major rich comes back what then he finds mr clayton there they i suppose they have a quarrel major rich stabs him then when he sees what he has done he he puts the body in the chest after all the guests i suppose might be arriving any minute yes yes the guests arrive the body is in the chest the evening passes the guests depart and then  well then i suppose major rich goes to bed and oh ah said poirot you see it now you have murdered a man you have concealed his body in a chest and then you go peacefully to bed quite unperturbed by the fact that your valet will discover the crime in the morning i suppose its possible that the valet might never have looked inside the chest with an enormous pool of blood on the carpet underneath it perhaps major rich didnt realize that the blood was there was it not somewhat careless of him not to look and see i dare say he was upset said miss lemon poirot threw up his hands in despair miss lemon seized the opportunity to hurry from the room the mystery of the spanish chest was strictly speaking no business of poirots he was engaged at the moment in a delicate mission for one of the large oil companies where one of the high ups was possibly involved in some questionable transaction it was hush hush important and exceedingly lucrative it was sufficiently involved to command poirots attention and had the great advantage that it required very little physical activity it was sophisticated and bloodless crime at the highest levels the mystery of the spanish chest was dramatic and emotional two qualities which poirot had often declared to hastings could be much overrated and indeed frequently were so by the latter he had been severe with ce cher hastings on this point and now here he was behaving much as his friend might have done obsessed with beautiful women crimes of passion jealousy hatred and all the other romantic causes of murder he wanted to know about it all he wanted to know what major rich was like and what his manservant burgess was like and what margharita clayton was like though that he thought he knew and what the late arnold clayton had been like since he held that the character of the victim was of the first importance in a murder case and even what commander mclaren the faithful friend and mr and mrs spence the recently acquired acquaintances were like and he did not see exactly how he was going to gratify his curiosity he reflected on the matter later in the day why did the whole business intrigue him so much he decided after reflection that it was because as the facts were related the whole thing was more or less impossible yes there was a euclidean flavour starting from what one could accept there had been a quarrel between two men cause presumably a woman one man killed the other in the heat of rage yes that happened though it would be more acceptable if the husband had killed the lover still the lover had killed the husband stabbed him with a dagger  somehow a rather unlikely weapon perhaps major rich had had an italian mother somewhere surely there should be something to explain the choice of a dagger as a weapon anyway one must accept the dagger some papers called it a stiletto it was to hand and was used the body was concealed in the chest that was common sense and inevitable the crime had not been premeditated and as the valet was returning at any moment and four guests would be arriving before very long it seemed the only course indicated the party is held the guests depart the manservant is already gone and major rich goes to bed to understand how that could happen one must see major rich and find out what kind of a man acts in that way could it be that overcome with horror at what he had done and the long strain of an evening trying to appear his normal self he had taken a sleeping pill of some kind or a tranquillizer which had put him into a heavy slumber which lasted long beyond his usual hour of waking possible or was it a case rewarding to a psychologist where major richs feeling of subconscious guilt made him want the crime to be discovered to make up ones mind on that point one would have to see major rich it all came back to  the telephone rang poirot it ring for some moments until he realized that miss lemon after bringing him his letters to sign had gone home some time ago and that george had probably gone out he picked up the receiver m poirot speaking oh how splendid poirot blinked slightly at the fervour of the charming female voice its abbie chatterton ah lady chatterton how can i serve you by coming over as quickly as you can right away to a simply frightful cocktail party i am giving not just for the cocktail party its for something quite different really i need you its absolutely vital please please please dont let me down dont say you cant manage it poirot had not been going to say anything of the kind lord chatterton apart from being a peer of the realm and occasionally making a very dull speech in the house of lords was nobody in particular but lady chatterton was one of the brightest jewels in what poirot called le haut monde everything she did or said was news she had brains beauty originality and enough vitality to activate a rocket to the moon she said again i need you just give that wonderful moustache of yours a lovely twirl and come it was not quite so quick as that poirot had first to make a meticulous toilet the twirl to the moustaches was added and he then set off the door of lady chattertons delightful house in cheriton street was ajar and a noise as of animals mutinying at the zoo sounded from within lady chatterton who was holding two ambassadors an international rugger player and an american evangelist in play neatly jettisoned them with the rapidity of sleight of hand and was at poirots side m poirot how wonderful to see you no dont have that nasty martini ive got something special for you a kind of sirop that the sheikhs drink in morocco its in my own little room upstairs she led the way upstairs and poirot followed her she paused to say over her shoulder i didnt put these people off because its absolutely essential that no one should know theres anything special going on here and ive promised the servants enormous bonuses if not a word leaks out after all one doesnt want ones house besieged by reporters and poor darling shes been through so much already lady chatterton did not stop at the first floor landing instead she swept on up to the floor above gasping for breath and somewhat bewildered hercule poirot followed lady chatterton paused gave a rapid glance downwards over the banisters and then flung open a door exclaiming as she did so ive got him margharita ive got him here he is she stood aside in triumph to let poirot enter then performed a rapid introduction this is margharita clayton shes a very very dear friend of mine youll help her wont you margharita this is that wonderful hercule poirot hell do just everything you want you will wont you dear m poirot and without waiting for the answer which she obviously took for granted lady chatterton had not been a spoilt beauty all her life for nothing she dashed out of the door and down the stairs calling back rather indiscreetly ive got to go back to all these awful people    the woman who had been sitting in a chair by the window rose and came towards him he would have recognized her even if lady chatterton had not mentioned her name here was that wide that very wide brow the dark hair that sprang away from it like wings the grey eyes set far apart she wore a close fitting high necked gown of dull black that showed up the beauty of her body and the magnolia whiteness of her skin it was an unusual face rather than a beautiful one one of those oddly proportioned faces that one sometimes sees in an italian primitive there was about her a kind of medieval simplicity a strange innocence that could be poirot thought more devastating than any voluptuous sophistication when she spoke it was with a kind of childlike candour abbie says you will help me    she looked at him gravely and inquiringly for a moment he stood quite still scrutinizing her closely there was nothing ill bred in his manner of doing it it was more the kind but searching look that a famous consultant gives a new patient are you sure madame he said at last that i can help you a little flush rose to her cheeks i dont know what you mean what is it madame that you want me to do oh she seemed surprised i thought you knew who i was i know who you are your husband was killed stabbed and a major rich has been arrested and charged with his murder the flush heightened major rich did not kill my husband quick as a flash poirot said why not she stared puzzled i i beg your pardon i have confused you because i have not asked the question that everybody asks the police the lawyers    why should major rich kill arnold clayton but i ask the opposite i ask you madame why you are sure that major rich did not kill him because she paused a moment because i know major rich so well you know major rich so well repeated poirot tonelessly he paused and then said sharply how well whether she understood his meaning he could not guess he thought to himself here is either a woman of great simplicity or of great subtlety    many people he thought must have wondered that about margharita clayton    how well she was looking at him doubtfully five years no nearly six that was not precisely what i meant    you must understand madame that i shall have to ask you the impertinent questions perhaps you will speak the truth perhaps you will lie it is very necessary for a woman to lie sometimes women must defend themselves and the lie it can be a good weapon but there are three people madame to whom a woman should speak the truth to her father confessor to her hairdresser and to her private detective if she trusts him do you trust me madame margharita clayton drew a deep breath yes she said i do and added i must very well then what is it you want me to do find out who killed your husband i suppose so yes but it is not essential you want me then to clear major rich from suspicion she nodded quickly gratefully that and that only it was he saw an unnecessary question margharita clayton was a woman who saw only one thing at a time and now he said for the impertinence you and major rich you are lovers yes do you mean were we having an affair together no but he was in love with you yes and you were in love with him i think so you do not seem quite sure i am sure now ah you did not then love your husband no you reply with an admirable simplicity most women would wish to explain at great length just exactly what their feelings were how long had you been married eleven years can you tell me a little about your husband what kind of a man he was she frowned its difficult i dont really know what kind of a man arnold was he was very quiet very reserved one didnt know what he was thinking he was clever of course everyone said he was brilliant in his work i mean    he didnt how can i put it he never explained himself at all    was he in love with you oh yes he must have been or he wouldnt have minded so much  she came to a sudden stop about other men that is what you were going to say he was jealous again she said he must have been and then as though feeling that the phrase needed explanation she went on sometimes for days he wouldnt speak    poirot nodded thoughtfully this violence that has come into your life is it the first that you have known violence she frowned then flushed is it do you mean that poor boy who shot himself yes said poirot i expect that is what i mean id no idea he felt like that    i was sorry for him he seemed so shy so lonely he must have been very neurotic i think and there were two italians a duel it was ridiculous anyway nobody was killed thank goodness    and honestly i didnt care about either of them i never even pretended to care no you were just there and where you are things happen i have seen that before in my life it is because you do not care that men are driven mad but for major rich you do care so we must do what we can    he was silent for a moment or two she sat there gravely watching him we turn from personalities which are often the really important things to plain facts i know only what has been in the papers on the facts as given there only two persons had the opportunity of killing your husband only two persons could have killed him major rich and major richs manservant she said stubbornly i know charles didnt kill him so then it must have been the valet you agree she said doubtfully i see what you mean    but you are dubious about it it just seems fantastic yet the possibility is there your husband undoubtedly came to the flat since his body was found there if the valets story is true major rich killed him but if the valets story is false then the valet killed him and hid the body in the chest before his master returned an excellent way of disposing of the body from his point of view he has only got to notice the bloodstain the next morning and discover it suspicion will immediately fall on rich but why should he want to kill arnold ah why the motive cannot be an obvious one or the police would have investigated it it is possible that your husband knew something to the valets discredit and was about to acquaint major rich with the facts did your husband ever say anything to you about this man burgess she shook her head do you think he would have done so if that had indeed been the case she frowned its difficult to say possibly not arnold never talked much about people i told you he was reserved he wasnt he was never a chatty man he was a man who kept his own counsel    yes now what is your opinion of burgess hes not the kind of man you notice very much a fairly good servant adequate but not polished what age about thirty seven or eight i should think hed been a batman in the army during the war but he wasnt a regular soldier how long had he been with major rich not very long about a year and a half i think you never noticed anything odd about his manner towards your husband we werent there so very often no i noticed nothing at all tell me now about the events of that evening what time were you invited eight fifteen for half past and just what kind of a party was it to be well there would be drinks and a kind of buffet supper usually a very good one foie gras and hot toast smoked salmon sometimes there was a hot rice dish charles had a special recipe hed got in the near east but that was more for winter then we used to have music charles had got a very good stereophonic gramophone both my husband and jock mclaren were very fond of classical records and we had dance music the spences were very keen dancers it was that sort of thing a quiet informal evening charles was a very good host and this particular evening it was like other evenings there you noticed nothing unusual nothing out of place out of place she frowned for a moment when you said that i no its gone there was something    she shook her head again no to answer your question there was nothing unusual at all about that evening we enjoyed ourselves everybody seemed relaxed and happy she shivered and to think that all the time  poirot held up a quick hand do not think this business that took your husband to scotland how much do you know about that not very much there was some dispute over the restrictions on selling a piece of land which belonged to my husband the sale had apparently gone through and then some sudden snag turned up what did your husband tell you exactly he came in with a telegram in his hand as far as i remember he said this is most annoying i shall have to take the night mail to edinburgh and see johnston first thing tomorrow morning    too bad when one thought the thing was going through smoothly at last then he said shall i ring up jock and get him to call for you and i said nonsense ill just take a taxi and he said that jock or the spences would see me home i said did he want anything packed and he said hed just throw a few things into a bag and have a quick snack at the club before catching the train then he went off and and thats the last time i saw him her voice broke a little on the last words poirot looked at her very hard did he show you the telegram no a pity why do you say that he did not answer that question instead he said briskly now to business who are the solicitors acting for major rich she told him and he made a note of the address will you write a few words to them and give it to me i shall want to make arrangements to see major rich he its been remanded for a week naturally that is the procedure will you also write a note to commander mclaren and to your friends the spences i shall want to see all of them and it is essential that they do not at once show me the door when she rose from the writing desk he said one thing more i shall register my own impressions but i also want yours of commander mclaren and of mr and mrs spence jock is one of our oldest friends ive known him ever since i was a child he appears to be quite a dour person but hes really a dear always the same always to be relied upon hes not gay and amusing but hes a tower of strength both arnold and i relied on his judgement a lot and he also is doubtless in love with you poirots eyes twinkled slightly oh yes said margharita happily hes always been in love with me but by now its become a kind of habit and the spences theyre amusing and very good company linda spence is really rather a clever girl arnold enjoyed talking with her shes attractive too you are friends she and i in a way i dont know that i really like her shes too malicious and her husband oh jeremy is delightful very musical knows a good deal about pictures too he and i go to picture shows a good deal together    ah well i shall see for myself he took her hand in his i hope madame you will not regret asking for my help why should i regret it her eyes opened wide one never knows said poirot cryptically and i i do not know he said to himself as he went down the stairs the cocktail party was still in full spate but he avoided being captured and reached the street no he repeated i do not know it was of margharita clayton he was thinking that apparently childlike candour that frank innocence was it just that or did it mask something else there had been women like that in medieval days women on whom history had not been able to agree he thought of mary stuart the scottish queen had she known that night in kirk o fields of the deed that was to be done or was she completely innocent had the conspirators told her nothing was she one of those childlike simple women who can say to themselves i do not know and believe it he felt the spell of margharita clayton but he was not entirely sure about her    such women could be though innocent themselves the cause of crimes such women could be in intent and design criminals themselves though not in action theirs was never the hand that held the knife  as to margharita clayton no he did not know hercule poirot did not find major richs solicitors very helpful he had not expected to do so they managed to indicate though without saying so that it would be in their clients best interest if mrs clayton showed no sign of activity on his behalf his visit to them was in the interests of correctness he had enough pull with the home office and the cid to arrange his interview with the prisoner inspector miller who was in charge of the clayton case was not one of poirots favourites he was not however hostile on this occasion merely contemptuous cant waste much time over the old dodderer he had said to his assisting sergeant before poirot was shown in still ill have to be polite youll really have to pull some rabbits out of a hat if youre going to do anything with this one m poirot he remarked cheerfully nobody else but rich could have killed the bloke except the valet oh ill give you the valet as a possibility that is but you wont find anything there no motives whatever you cannot be entirely sure of that motives are very curious things well he wasnt acquainted with clayton in any way hes got a perfectly innocuous past and he seems to be perfectly right in his head i dont know what more you want i want to find out that rich did not commit the crime to please the lady eh inspector miller grinned wickedly shes been getting at you i suppose quite something isnt she cherchez la femme with a vengeance if shed had the opportunity you know she might have done it herself that no youd be surprised i once knew a woman like that put a couple of husbands out of the way without a blink of her innocent blue eyes brokenhearted each time too the jury would have acquitted her if theyd had half a chance which they hadnt the evidence being practically cast iron well my friend let us not argue what i make so bold as to ask is a few reliable details on the facts what a newspaper prints is news but not always truth they have to enjoy themselves what do you want time of death as near as can be which cant be very near because the body wasnt examined until the following morning death is estimated to have taken place from thirteen to ten hours previously that is between seven and ten oclock the night before    he was stabbed through the jugular vein death must have been a matter of moments and the weapon a kind of italian stiletto quite small razor sharp nobody has ever seen it before or knows where it comes from but we shall know in the end    its a matter of time and patience it could not have been picked up in the course of a quarrel no the valet says no such thing was in the flat what interests me is the telegram said poirot the telegram that called arnold clayton away to scotland    was that summons genuine no there was no hitch or trouble up there the land transfer or whatever it was was proceeding normally then who sent that telegram i am presuming there was a telegram there must have been    not that wed necessarily believe mrs clayton but clayton told the valet he was called by wire to scotland and he also told commander mclaren what time did he see commander mclaren they had a snack together at their club combined services that was at about a quarter past seven then clayton took a taxi to richs flat arriving there just before eight oclock after that  miller spread his hands out anybody notice anything at all odd about richs manner that evening oh well you know what people are once a thing has happened people think they noticed a lot of things i bet they never saw at all mrs spence now she says he was distrait all the evening didnt always answer to the point as though he had something on his mind i bet he had too if he had a body in the chest wondering how the hell to get rid of it why didnt he get rid of it beats me lost his nerve perhaps but it was madness to leave it until next day he had the best chance hed ever have that night theres no night porter on he could have got his car round packed the body in the boot its a big boot driven out in the country and parked it somewhere he might have been seen getting the body into the car but the flats are in a side street and theres a courtyard you drive a car through at say three in the morning he had a reasonable chance and what does he do goes to bed sleeps late the next morning and wakes up to find the police in the flat he went to bed and slept well as an innocent man might do have it that way if you like but do you really believe that yourself i shall have to leave that question until i have seen the man myself think you know an innocent man when you see one its not so easy as that i know it is not easy and i should not attempt to say i could do it what i want to make up my mind about is whether the man is as stupid as he seems to be poirot had no intention of seeing charles rich until he had seen everyone else he started with commander mclaren mclaren was a tall swarthy uncommunicative man he had a rugged but pleasant face he was a shy man and not easy to talk to but poirot persevered fingering margharitas note mclaren said almost reluctantly well if margharita wants me to tell you all i can of course ill do so dont know what there is to tell though youve heard it all already but whatever margharita wants ive always done what she wanted ever since she was sixteen shes got a way with her you know i know said poirot he went on first i should like you to answer a question quite frankly do you think major rich is guilty yes i do i wouldnt say so to margharita if she wants to think hes innocent but i simply cant see it any other way hang it all the fellows got to be guilty was there bad feeling between him and mr clayton not in the least arnold and charles were the best of friends thats what makes the whole thing so extraordinary perhaps major richs friendship with mrs clayton  he was interrupted faugh all that stuff all the papers slyly hinting at it    damned innuendoes mrs clayton and rich were good friends and thats all margharitas got lots of friends im her friend been one for years and nothing the whole world mightnt know about it same with charles and margharita you do not then consider that they were having an affair together certainly not mclaren was wrathful dont go listening to that hell cat spence woman shed say anything but perhaps mr clayton suspected there might be something between his wife and major rich you can take it from me he did nothing of the sort id have known if so arnold and i were very close what sort of man was he you if anyone should know well arnold was a quiet sort of chap but he was clever quite brilliant i believe what they call a first class financial brain he was quite high up in the treasury you know so i have heard he read a good deal and he collected stamps and he was extremely fond of music he didnt dance or care much for going out was it do you think a happy marriage commander mclarens answer did not come quickly he seemed to be puzzling it out that sort of things very hard to say    yes i think they were happy he was devoted to her in his quiet way im sure she was fond of him they werent likely to split up if thats what youre thinking they hadnt perhaps a lot in common poirot nodded it was as much as he was likely to get he said now tell me about that last evening mr clayton dined with you at the club what did he say told me hed got to go to scotland seemed vexed about it we didnt have dinner by the way no time just sandwiches and a drink for him that is i only had the drink i was going out to a buffet supper remember mr clayton mentioned a telegram yes he did not actually show you the telegram no did he say he was going to call on rich not definitely in fact he said he doubted if hed have time he said margharita can explain or you can and then he said see she gets home all right wont you then he went off it was all quite natural and easy he had no suspicion at all that the telegram wasnt genuine wasnt it commander mclaren looked startled apparently not how very odd    commander mclaren went into a kind of coma emerging suddenly to say but that really is odd i mean whats the point why should anybody want him to go to scotland it is a question that needs answering certainly hercule poirot left leaving the commander apparently still puzzling on the matter the spences lived in a minute house in chelsea linda spence received poirot with the utmost delight do tell me she said tell me all about margharita where is she that i am not at liberty to state madame she has hidden herself well margharita is very clever at that sort of thing but shell be called to give evidence at the trial i suppose she cant wiggle herself out of that poirot looked at her appraisingly he decided grudgingly that she was attractive in the modern style which at that moment resembled an underfed orphan child it was not a type he admired the artistically disordered hair fluffed out round her head a pair of shrewd eyes watched him from a slightly dirty face devoid of make up save for a vivid cerise mouth she wore an enormous pale yellow sweater hanging almost to her knees and tight black trousers whats your part in all this demanded mrs spence get the boyfriend out of it somehow is that it what a hope you think then that he is guilty of course who else that poirot thought was very much the question he parried it by asking another question what did major rich seem to you like on that fatal evening as usual or not as usual linda spence screwed up her eyes judicially no he wasnt himself he was different how different well surely if youve just stabbed a man in cold blood  but you were not aware at the time that he had just stabbed a man in cold blood were you no of course not so how did you account for his being different in what way well distrait oh i dont know but thinking it over afterwards i decided that there had definitely been something poirot sighed who arrived first we did jim and i and then jock and finally margharita when was mr claytons departure for scotland first mentioned when margharita came she said to charles arnolds terribly sorry hes had to rush off to edinburgh by the night train and charles said oh thats too bad and then jock said sorry thought you already knew and then we had drinks major rich at no time mentioned seeing mr clayton that evening he said nothing of his having called in on his way to the station not that i heard it was strange was it not said poirot about that telegram what was strange it was a fake nobody in edinburgh knows anything about it so thats it i wondered at the time you have an idea about the telegram i should say it rather leaps to the eye how do you mean exactly my dear man said linda dont play the innocent unknown hoaxer gets the husband out of the way for that night at all events the coast is clear you mean that major rich and mrs clayton planned to spend the night together you have heard of such things havent you linda looked amused and the telegram was sent by one or the other of them it wouldnt surprise me major rich and mrs clayton were having an affair together you think lets say i shouldnt be surprised if they were i dont know it for a fact did mr clayton suspect arnold was an extraordinary person he was all bottled up if you know what i mean i think he did know but he was the kind of man who would never have let on anyone would think he was a dry stick with no feelings at all but im pretty sure he wasnt like that underneath the queer thing is that i should have been much less surprised if arnold had stabbed charles than the other way about ive an idea arnold was really an insanely jealous person that is interesting though its more likely really that hed have done in margharita othello that sort of thing margharita you know had an extraordinary effect on men she is a good looking woman said poirot with judicious understatement it was more than that she had something she would get men all her up mad about her and turn round and look at them with a sort of wide eyed surprise that drove them barmy une femme fatale thats probably the foreign name for it you know her well my dear shes one of my best friends and i wouldnt trust her an inch ah said poirot and shifted the subject to commander mclaren jock old faithful hes a pet born to be the friend of the family he and arnold were really close friends i think arnold unbent to him more than to anyone else and of course he was margharitas tame cat hed been devoted to her for years and was mr clayton jealous of him too jealous of jock what an idea margharitas genuinely fond of jock but shes never given him a thought of that kind i dont think really that one ever would    i dont know why    it seems a shame hes so nice poirot switched to consideration of the valet but beyond saying vaguely that he mixed a very good side car linda spence seemed to have no ideas about burgess and indeed seemed barely to have noticed him but she was quite quick in the uptake youre thinking i suppose that he could have killed arnold just as easily as charles could it seems to me madly unlikely that remark depresses me madame but then it seems to me though you will probably not agree that it is madly unlikely not that major rich should kill arnold clayton but that he should kill him in just the way he did stiletto stuff yes definitely not in character more likely the blunt instrument or he might have strangled him perhaps poirot sighed we are back at othello yes othello    you have given me there a little idea    have i what  there was the sound of a latchkey and an opening door oh heres jeremy do you want to talk to him too jeremy spence was a pleasant looking man of thirty odd well groomed and almost ostentatiously discreet mrs spence said that she had better go and have a look at a casserole in the kitchen and went off leaving the two men together jeremy spence displayed none of the engaging candour of his wife he was clearly disliking very much being mixed up in the case at all and his remarks were carefully noninformative they had known the claytons some time rich not so well had seemed a pleasant fellow as far as he could remember rich had seemed absolutely as usual on the evening in question clayton and rich always seemed on good terms the whole thing seemed quite unaccountable throughout the conversation jeremy spence was making it clear that he expected poirot to take his departure he was civil but only just so i am afraid said poirot that you do not like these questions well weve had quite a session of this with the police i rather feel thats enough weve told all we know or saw now id like to forget it you have my sympathy it is most unpleasant to be mixed up in this to be asked not only what you know or what you saw but perhaps even what you think best not to think but can one avoid it do you think for instance that mrs clayton was in it too did she plan the death of her husband with rich good lord no spence sounded shocked and dismayed id no idea that there was any question of such a thing has your wife not suggested such a possibility oh linda you know what women are always got their knife into each other margharita never gets much of a show from her own sex a darned sight too attractive but surely this theory about rich and margharita planning murder thats fantastic such things have been known the weapon for instance it is the kind of weapon a woman might possess rather than a man do you mean the police have traced it to her they cant have i mean  i know nothing said poirot truthfully and escaped hastily from the consternation on spences face he judged that he had left that gentleman something to think about you will forgive my saying m poirot that i cannot see how you can be of assistance to me in any way poirot did not answer he was looking thoughtfully at the man who had been charged with the murder of his friend arnold clayton he was looking at the firm jaw the narrow head a lean brown man athletic and sinewy something of the greyhound about him a man whose face gave nothing away and who was receiving his visitor with a marked lack of cordiality i quite understand that mrs clayton sent you to see me with the best intentions but quite frankly i think she was unwise unwise both for her own sake and mine you mean rich gave a nervous glance over his shoulder but the attendant warder was the regulation distance away rich lowered his voice theyve got to find a motive for this ridiculous accusation theyll try to bring that there was an association between mrs clayton and myself that as i know mrs clayton will have told you is quite untrue we are friends nothing more but surely it is advisable that she should make no move on my behalf hercule poirot ignored the point instead he picked out a word you said this ridiculous accusation but it is not that you know i did not kill arnold clayton call it then a false accusation say the accusation is not true but it is not ridiculous on the contrary it is highly plausible you must know that very well i can only tell you that to me it seems fantastic saying that will be of very little use to you we must think of something more useful than that i am represented by solicitors they have briefed i understand eminent counsel to appear for my defence i cannot accept your use of the word we  unexpectedly poirot smiled ah he said in his most foreign manner that is the flea in the ear you give me very well i go i wanted to see you i have seen you already i have looked up your career you passed high up into sandhurst you passed into the staff college and so on and so on i have made my own judgement of you today you are not a stupid man and what has all that got to do with it everything it is impossible that a man of your ability should commit a murder in the way this one was committed very well you are innocent tell me now about your manservant burgess burgess yes if you didnt kill clayton burgess must have done so the conclusion seems inescapable but why there must be a why you are the only person who knows burgess well enough to make a guess at it why major rich why i cant imagine i simply cant see it oh ive followed the same line of reasoning as you have yes burgess had opportunity the only person who had except myself the trouble is i just cant believe it burgess is not the sort of man you can imagine murdering anybody what do your legal advisers think richs lips set in a grim line my legal advisers spend their time asking me in a persuasive way if it isnt true that i have suffered all my life from blackouts when i dont really know what i am doing as bad as that said poirot well perhaps we shall find it is burgess who is subject to blackouts it is always an idea the weapon now they showed it to you and asked you if it was yours it was not mine i had never seen it before it was not yours no but are you quite sure you had never seen it before no was there a faint hesitation its a kind of ornamental toy really one sees things like that lying about in peoples houses in a womans drawing room perhaps perhaps in mrs claytons drawing room certainly not the last word came out loudly and the warder looked up trs bien certainly not and there is no need to shout but somewhere at some time you have seen something very like it eh i am right i do not think so    in some curio shop    perhaps ah very likely poirot rose i take my leave and now said hercule poirot for burgess yes at long last for burgess he had learnt something about the people in the case from themselves and from each other but nobody had given him any knowledge of burgess no clue no hint of what kind of a man he was when he saw burgess he realized why the valet was waiting for him at major richs flat apprised of his arrival by a telephone call from commander mclaren i am m hercule poirot yes sir i was expecting you burgess held back the door with a deferential hand and poirot entered a small square entrance hall a door on the left open leading into the sitting room burgess relieved poirot of his hat and coat and followed him into the sitting room ah said poirot looking round it was here then that it happened yes sir a quiet fellow burgess white faced a little weedy awkward shoulders and elbows a flat voice with a provincial accent that poirot did not know from the east coast perhaps rather a nervous man perhaps but otherwise no definite characteristics it was hard to associate him with positive action of any kind could one postulate a negative killer he had those pale blue rather shifty eyes that unobservant people often equate with dishonesty yet a liar can look you in the face with a bold and confident eye what is happening to the flat poirot inquired im still looking after it sir major rich arranged for my pay and to keep it nice until until  the eyes shifted uncomfortably until  agreed poirot he added in a matter of fact manner i should say that major rich will almost certainly be committed for trial the case will come up probably within three months burgess shook his head not in denial simply in perplexity it really doesnt seem possible he said that major rich should be a murderer the whole thing that chest  his eyes went across the room ah so that is the famous chest it was a mammoth piece of furniture of very dark polished wood studded with brass with a great brass hasp and antique lock a handsome affair poirot went over to it it stood against the wall near the window next to a modern cabinet for holding records on the other side of it was a door half ajar the door was partly masked by a big painted leather screen that leads into major richs bedroom said burgess poirot nodded his eyes travelled to the other side of the room there were two stereophonic record players each on a low table trailing cords of snakelike flex there were easy chairs a big table on the walls were a set of japanese prints it was a handsome room comfortable but not luxurious he looked back at william burgess the discovery he said kindly must have been a great shock to you oh it was sir ill never forget it the valet rushed into speech words poured from him he felt perhaps that by telling the story often enough he might at last expunge it from his mind id gone round the room sir clearing up glasses and so on id just stooped to pick up a couple of olives off the floor and i saw it on the rug a rusty dark stain no the rugs gone now to the cleaners the police had done with it whatevers that i thought saying to myself almost in joke like really it might be blood but where does it come from what got spilt and then i saw it was from the chest down the side here where theres a crack and i said still not thinking anything well whatever  and i lifted up the lid like this he suited the action to the word and there it was the body of a man lying on his side doubled up like he might be asleep and that nasty foreign knife or dagger thing sticking up out of his neck ill never forget it never not as long as i live the shock not expecting it you understand    he breathed deeply i let the lid fall and i ran out of the flat and down to the street looking for a policeman and lucky i found one just round the corner poirot regarded him reflectively the performance if it was a performance was very good he began to be afraid that it was not a performance that it was just how things had happened you did not think of awakening first major rich he asked it never occurred to me sir what with the shock i i just wanted to get out of here  he swallowed and and get help poirot nodded did you realize that it was mr clayton he asked i ought to have sir but you know i dont believe i did of course as soon as i got back with the police officer i said why its mr clayton and he says whos mr clayton and i says he was here last night  ah said poirot last night    do you remember exactly when it was mr clayton arrived here not to the minute but as near as not a quarter to eight id say    you knew him well he and mrs clayton had been here quite frequently during the year and a half ive been employed here did he seem quite as usual i think so a little out of breath but i took it hed been hurrying he was catching a train or so he said he had a bag with him i suppose as he was going to scotland no sir i imagine he was keeping a taxi down below was he disappointed to find that major rich was out not to notice just said hed scribble a note he came in here and went over to the desk and i went back to the kitchen i was a little behindhand with the anchovy eggs the kitchens at the end of the passage and you dont hear very well from there i didnt hear him go out or the master come in but then i wouldnt expect to and the next thing major rich called me he was standing in the door here he said hed forgotten mrs spences turkish cigarettes i was to hurry out and get them so i did i brought them back and put them on the table in here of course i took it that mr clayton had left by then to get his train and nobody else came to the flat during the time major rich was out and you were in the kitchen no sir no one can you be sure of that how could anyone sir theyd have had to ring the bell poirot shook his head how could anyone the spences and mclaren and also mrs clayton could he already knew account for every minute of their time mclaren had been with acquaintances at the club the spences had had a couple of friends in for a drink before starting margharita clayton had talked to a friend on the telephone at just that period not that he thought of any of them as possibilities there would have been better ways of killing arnold clayton than following him to a flat with a manservant there and the host returning any moment no he had had a last minute hope of a mysterious stranger someone out of claytons apparently impeccable past recognizing him in the street following him here attacking him with the stiletto thrusting the body into the chest and fleeing pure melodrama unrelated to reason or to probabilities in tune with romantic historical fictions matching the spanish chest he went back across the room to the chest he raised the lid it came up easily noiselessly in a faint voice burgess said its been scrubbed out sir i saw to that poirot bent over it with a faint exclamation he bent lower he explored with his fingers these holes at the back and one side they look they feel as though they had been made quite recently holes sir the valet bent to see i really couldnt say ive never noticed them particularly they are not very obvious but they are there what is their purpose would you say i really wouldnt know sir some animal perhaps i mean a beetle something of that kind something that gnaws wood some animal said poirot i wonder he stepped back across the room when you came in here with the cigarettes was there anything at all about this room that looked different anything at all chairs moved table something of that kind its odd your saying that sir    now you come to mention it there was that screen there that cuts off the draught from the bedroom door it was moved over a bit more to the left like this poirot moved swiftly a little more still    thats right the screen had already masked about half of the chest the way it was now arranged it almost hid the chest altogether why did you think it had been moved i didnt think sir another miss lemon burgess added doubtfully i suppose it leaves the way into the bedroom clearer if the ladies wanted to leave their wraps perhaps but there might be another reason burgess looked inquiring the screen hides the chest now and it hides the rug below the chest if major rich stabbed mr clayton blood would presently start dripping through the cracks at the base of the chest someone might notice as you noticed the next morning so the screen was moved i never thought of that sir what are the lights like here strong or dim ill show you sir quickly the valet drew the curtains and switched on a couple of lamps they gave a soft mellow light hardly strong enough even to read by poirot glanced up at a ceiling light that wasnt on sir its very little used poirot looked round in the soft glow the valet said i dont believe youd see any bloodstains sir its too dim i think you are right so then why was the screen moved burgess shivered its awful to think of a nice gentleman like major rich doing a thing like that youve no doubt that he did do it why did he do it burgess well hed been through the war of course he might have had a head wound mightnt he they do say as sometimes it all flares up years afterwards they suddenly go all queer and dont know what theyre doing and they say as often as not its their nearest and dearest as they goes for do you think it could have been like that poirot gazed at him he sighed he turned away no he said it was not like that with the air of a conjuror a piece of crisp paper was insinuated into burgesss hand oh thank you sir but really i dont  you have helped me said poirot by showing me this room by showing me what is in the room by showing me what took place that evening the impossible is never impossible remember that i said that there were only two possibilities i was wrong there is a third possibility he looked round the room again and gave a little shiver pull back the curtains let in the light and the air this room needs it it needs cleansing it will be a long time i think before it is purified from what afflicts it the lingering memory of hate burgess his mouth open handed poirot his hat and coat he seemed bewildered poirot who enjoyed making incomprehensible statements went down to the street with a brisk step when poirot got home he made a telephone call to inspector miller what happened to claytons bag his wife said he had packed one it was at the club he left it with the porter then he must have forgotten it and gone off without it what was in it what youd expect pyjamas extra shirt washing things very thorough what did you expect would be in it poirot ignored that question he said about the stiletto i suggest that you get hold of whatever cleaning woman attends mrs spences house find out if she ever saw anything like it lying about there mrs spence miller whistled is that the way your mind is working the spences were shown the stiletto they didnt recognize it ask them again do you mean  and then let me know what they say  i cant imagine what you think you have got hold of read othello miller consider the characters in othello weve missed out one of them he rang off next he dialled lady chatterton the number was engaged he tried again a little later still no success he called for george his valet and instructed him to continue ringing the number until he got a reply lady chatterton he knew was an incorrigible telephoner he sat down in a chair carefully eased off his patent leather shoes stretched his toes and leaned back i am old said hercule poirot i tire easily    he brightened but the cells they still function slowly but they function    othello yes who was it said that to me ah yes mrs spence the bag    the screen    the body lying there like a man asleep a clever murder premeditated planned    i think enjoyed    george announced to him that lady chatterton was on the line hercule poirot here madame may i speak to your guest why of course oh m poirot have you done something wonderful not yet said poirot but possibly it marches presently margharitas voice quiet gentle madame when i asked you if you noticed anything out of place that evening at the party you frowned as though you remembered something and then it escaped you would it have been the position of the screen that night the screen why of course yes it was not quite in its usual place did you dance that night part of the time who did you dance with mostly jeremy spence hes a wonderful dancer charles is good but not spectacular he and linda danced and now and then we changed jock mclaren doesnt dance he got out the records and sorted them and arranged what wed have you had serious music later yes there was a pause then margharita said m poirot what is all this have you is there hope do you ever know madame what the people around you are feeling her voice faintly surprised said i suppose so i suppose not i think you have no idea i think that is the tragedy of your life but the tragedy is for other people not for you someone today mentioned to me othello i asked you if your husband was jealous and you said you thought he must be but you said it quite lightly you said it as desdemona might have said it not realizing danger she too recognized jealousy but she did not understand it because she herself never had and never could experience jealousy she was i think quite unaware of the force of acute physical passion she loved her husband with the romantic fervour of hero worship she loved her friend cassio quite innocently as a close companion    i think that because of her immunity to passion she herself drove men mad    am i making sense to you madame there was a pause and then margharitas voice answered cool sweet a little bewildered i dont i dont really understand what you are saying    poirot sighed he spoke in matter of fact tones this evening he said i pay you a visit inspector miller was not an easy man to persuade but equally hercule poirot was not an easy man to shake off until he had got his way inspector miller grumbled but capitulated  though what lady chattertons got to do with this  nothing really she has provided asylum for a friend that is all about those spences how did you know that stiletto came from there it was a mere guess something jeremy spence said gave me the idea i suggested that the stiletto belonged to margharita clayton he showed that he knew positively that it did not he paused what did they say he asked with some curiosity admitted that it was very like a toy dagger theyd once had but it had been mislaid some weeks ago and they had really forgotten about it i suppose rich pinched it from there a man who likes to play safe mr jeremy spence said hercule poirot he muttered to himself some weeks ago    oh yes the planning began a long time ago eh whats that we arrive said poirot the taxi drew up at lady chattertons house in cheriton street poirot paid the fare margharita clayton was waiting for them in the room upstairs her face hardened when she saw miller i didnt know  you did not know who the friend was i proposed to bring inspector miller is not a friend of mine that rather depends on whether you want to see justice done or not mrs clayton your husband was murdered  and now we have to talk of who killed him said poirot quickly may we sit down madame slowly margharita sat down in a high backed chair facing the two men i ask said poirot addressing both his hearers to listen to me patiently i think i now know what happened on that fatal evening at major richs flat    we started all of us by an assumption that was not true the assumption that there were only two persons who had the opportunity of putting the body in the chest that is to say major rich or william burgess but we were wrong there was a third person at the flat that evening who had an equally good opportunity to do so and who was that demanded miller sceptically the lift boy no arnold clayton what concealed his own dead body youre crazy naturally not a dead body a live one in simple terms he hid himself in the chest a thing that has often been done throughout the course of history the dead bride in the misletoe bough iachimo with designs on the virtue of imogen and so on i thought of it as soon as i saw that there had been holes bored in the chest quite recently why they were made so that there might be a sufficiency of air in the chest why was the screen moved from its usual position that evening so as to hide the chest from the people in the room so that the hidden man could lift the lid from time to time and relieve his cramp and hear better what went on but why demanded margharita wide eyed with astonishment why should arnold want to hide in the chest is it you who ask that madame your husband was a jealous man he was also an inarticulate man bottled up as your friend mrs spence put it his jealousy mounted it tortured him were you or were you not richs mistress he did not know he had to know so a telegram from scotland the telegram that was never sent and that no one ever saw the overnight bag is packed and conveniently forgotten at the club he goes to the flat at a time when he has probably ascertained rich will be out he tells the valet he will write a note as soon as he is left alone he bores the holes in the chest moves the screen and climbs inside the chest tonight he will know the truth perhaps his wife will stay behind the others perhaps she will go but come back again that night the desperate jealousy racked man will know    youre not saying he stabbed himself millers voice was incredulous nonsense oh no someone else stabbed him somebody who knew he was there it was murder all right carefully planned long premeditated murder think of the other characters in othello it is iago we should have remembered subtle poisoning of arnold claytons mind hints suspicions honest iago the faithful friend the man you always believe arnold clayton believed him arnold clayton let his jealousy be played upon be roused to fever pitch was the plan of hiding in the chest arnolds own idea he may have thought it was probably he did think so and so the scene is set the stiletto quietly abstracted some weeks earlier is ready the evening comes the lights are low the gramophone is playing two couples dance the odd man out is busy at the record cabinet close to the spanish chest and its masking screen to slip behind the screen lift the lid and strike audacious but quite easy clayton would have cried out not if he were drugged said poirot according to the valet the body was lying like a man asleep clayton was asleep drugged by the only man who could have drugged him the man he had had a drink with at the club jock margharitas voice rose high in childlike surprise jock not dear old jock why ive known jock all my life why on earth should jock     poirot turned on her why did two italians fight a duel why did a young man shoot himself jock mclaren is an inarticulate man he has resigned himself perhaps to being the faithful friend to you and your husband but then comes major rich as well it is too much in the darkness of hate and desire he plans what is well nigh the perfect murder a double murder for rich is almost certain to be found guilty of it and with rich and your husband both out of the way he thinks that at last you may turn to him and perhaps madame you would have done    eh she was staring at him wide eyed horror struck    almost unconsciously she breathed perhaps    i dont know    inspector miller spoke with sudden authority this is all very well poirot its a theory nothing more theres not a shred of evidence probably not a word of it is true it is all true but theres no evidence theres nothing we can act on you are wrong i think that mclaren if this is put to him will admit it that is if it is made clear to him that margharita clayton knows    poirot paused and added because once he knows that he has lost    the perfect murder has been in vain the original version of this story the mystery of the baghdad chest can be found in the volume while the light lasts and other stories nine ,1932,1385,17576,13820,89.11439511094162,9.978339350180505,1.2717800289435601, punctual to the moment as always hercule poirot entered the small room where miss lemon his efficient secretary awaited her instructions for the day at first sight miss lemon seemed to be composed entirely of angles thus satisfying poirots demand for symmetry not that where women were concerned hercule poirot carried his passion for geometrical precision so far he was on the contrary old fashioned he had a continental prejudice for curves it might be said for voluptuous curves he liked women to be women he liked them lush highly coloured exotic there had been a certain russian countess but that was long ago now a folly of earlier days but miss lemon he had never considered as a woman she was a human machine an instrument of precision her efficiency was terrific she was forty eight years of age and was fortunate enough to have no imagination whatever good morning miss lemon good morning m poirot poirot sat down and miss lemon placed before him the mornings mail neatly arranged in categories she resumed her seat and sat with pad and pencil at the ready but there was to be this morning a slight change in routine poirot had brought in with him the morning newspaper and his eyes were scanning it with interest the headlines were big and bold spanish chest mystery latest developments you have read the morning papers i presume miss lemon yes m poirot the news from geneva is not very good poirot waved away the news from geneva in a comprehensive sweep of the arm a spanish chest he mused can you tell me miss lemon what exactly is a spanish chest i suppose m poirot that it is a chest that came originally from spain one might reasonably suppose so you have then no expert knowledge they are usually of the elizabethan period i believe large and with a good deal of brass decoration on them they look very nice when well kept and polished my sister bought one at a sale she keeps household linen in it it looks very nice i am sure that in the house of any sister of yours all the furniture would be well kept said poirot bowing gracefully miss lemon replied sadly that servants did not seem to know what elbow grease was nowadays poirot looked a little puzzled but decided not to inquire into the inward meaning of the mysterious phrase elbow grease he looked down again at the newspaper conning over the names major rich mr and mrs clayton commander mclaren mr and mrs spence names nothing but names to him yet all possessed of human personalities hating loving fearing a drama this in which he hercule poirot had no part and he would have liked to have a part in it six people at an evening party in a room with a big spanish chest against the wall six people five of them talking eating a buffet supper putting records on the gramophone dancing and the sixth dead in the spanish chest    ah thought poirot how my dear friend hastings would have enjoyed this what romantic flights of imagination he would have had what ineptitudes he would have uttered ah ce cher hastings at this moment today i miss him    instead  he sighed and looked at miss lemon miss lemon intelligently perceiving that poirot was in no mood to dictate letters had uncovered her typewriter and was awaiting her moment to get on with certain arrears of work nothing could have interested her less than sinister spanish chests containing dead bodies poirot sighed and looked down at a photographed face reproductions in newsprint were never very good and this was decidedly smudgy but what a face mrs clayton the wife of the murdered man    on an impulse he thrust the paper at miss lemon look he demanded look at that face miss lemon looked at it obediently without emotion what do you think of her miss lemon that is mrs clayton miss lemon took the paper glanced casually at the picture and remarked shes a little like the wife of our bank manager when we lived at croydon heath interesting said poirot recount to me if you will be so kind the history of your bank managers wife well its not really a very pleasant story m poirot it was in my mind that it might not be continue there was a good deal of talk about mrs adams and a young artist then mr adams shot himself but mrs adams wouldnt marry the other man and he took some kind of poison but they pulled him through all right and finally mrs adams married a young solicitor i believe there was more trouble after that only of course wed left croydon heath by then so i didnt hear very much more about it hercule poirot nodded gravely she was beautiful well not really what youd call beautiful but there seemed to be something about her  exactly what is that something that they possess the sirens of this world the helens of troy the cleopatras  miss lemon inserted a piece of paper vigorously into her typewriter really m poirot ive never thought about it it seems all very silly to me if people would just go on with their jobs and didnt think about such things it would be much better having thus disposed of human frailty and passion miss lemon let her fingers hover over the keys of the typewriter waiting impatiently to be allowed to begin her work that is your view said poirot and at this moment it is your desire that you should be allowed to get on with your job but your job miss lemon is not only to take down my letters to file my papers to deal with my telephone calls to typewrite my letters all these things you do admirably but me i deal not only with documents but with human beings and there too i need assistance certainly m poirot said miss lemon patiently what is it you want me to do this case interests me i should be glad if you would make a study of this mornings report of it in all the papers and also of any additional reports in the evening papers make me a prcis of the facts very good m poirot poirot withdrew to his sitting room a rueful smile on his face it is indeed the irony he said to himself that after my dear friend hastings i should have miss lemon what greater contrast can one imagine ce cher hastings how he would have enjoyed himself how he would have walked up and down talking about it putting the most romantic construction on every incident believing as gospel truth every word the papers have printed about it and my poor miss lemon what i have asked her to do she will not enjoy at all miss lemon came to him in due course with a typewritten sheet ive got the information you wanted m poirot im afraid though it cant be regarded as reliable the papers vary a good deal in their accounts i shouldnt like to guarantee that the facts as stated are more than sixty per cent accurate that is probably a conservative estimate murmured poirot thank you miss lemon for the trouble you have taken the facts were sensational but clear enough major charles rich a well to do bachelor had given an evening party to a few of his friends at his apartment these friends consisted of mr and mrs clayton mr and mrs spence and a commander mclaren commander mclaren was a very old friend of both rich and the claytons mr and mrs spence a younger couple were fairly recent acquaintances arnold clayton was in the treasury jeremy spence was a junior civil servant major rich was forty eight arnold clayton was fifty five commander mclaren was forty six jeremy spence was thirty seven mrs clayton was said to be some years younger than her husband one person was unable to attend the party at the last moment mr clayton was called away to scotland on urgent business and was supposed to have left kings cross by the  train the party proceeded as such parties do everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves it was neither a wild party nor a drunken one it broke up about  the four guests left together and shared a taxi commander mclaren was dropped first at his club and then the spences dropped margharita clayton at cardigan gardens just off sloane street and went on themselves to their house in chelsea the gruesome discovery was made on the following morning by major richs manservant william burgess the latter did not live in he arrived early so as to clear up the sitting room before calling major rich with his early morning tea it was whilst clearing up that burgess was startled to find a big stain discolouring the light coloured rug on which stood the spanish chest it seemed to have seeped through from the chest and the valet immediately lifted up the lid of the chest and looked inside he was horrified to find there the body of mr clayton stabbed through the neck obeying his first impulse burgess rushed out into the street and fetched the nearest policeman such were the bald facts of the case but there were further details the police had immediately broken the news to mrs clayton who had been completely prostrated she had seen her husband for the last time at a little after six oclock on the evening before he had come home much annoyed having been summoned to scotland on urgent business in connection with some property that he owned he had urged his wife to go to the party without him mr clayton had then called in at his and commander mclarens club had had a drink with his friend and had explained the position he had then said looking at his watch that he had just time on his way to kings cross to call in on major rich and explain he had already tried to telephone him but the line had seemed to be out of order according to william burgess mr clayton arrived at the flat at about  major rich was out but was due to return any moment so burgess suggested that mr clayton should come in and wait clayton said he had no time but would come in and write a note he explained that he was on his way to catch a train at kings cross the valet showed him into the sitting room and himself returned to the kitchen where he was engaged in the preparation of canaps for the party the valet did not hear his master return but about ten minutes later major rich looked into the kitchen and told burgess to hurry out and get some turkish cigarettes which were mrs spences favourite smoking the valet did so and brought them to his master in the sitting room mr clayton was not there but the valet naturally thought he had already left to catch his train major richs story was short and simple mr clayton was not in the flat when he himself came in and he had no idea that he had been there no note had been left for him and the first he heard of mr claytons journey to scotland was when mrs clayton and the others arrived there were two additional items in the evening papers mrs clayton who was prostrated with shock had left her flat in cardigan gardens and was believed to be staying with friends the second item was in the stop press major charles rich had been charged with the murder of arnold clayton and had been taken into custody so that is that said poirot looking up at miss lemon the arrest of major rich was to be expected but what a remarkable case what a very remarkable case do you not think so i suppose such things do happen m poirot said miss lemon without interest oh certainly they happen every day or nearly every day but usually they are quite understandable though distressing it is certainly a very unpleasant business to be stabbed to death and stowed away in a spanish chest is certainly unpleasant for the victim supremely so but when i say this is a remarkable case i refer to the remarkable behaviour of major rich miss lemon said with faint distaste there seems to be a suggestion that major rich and mrs clayton were very close friends    it was a suggestion and not a proved fact so i did not include it that was very correct of you but it is an inference that leaps to the eye is that all you have to say miss lemon looked blank poirot sighed and missed the rich colourful imagination of his friend hastings discussing a case with miss lemon was uphill work consider for a moment this major rich he is in love with mrs clayton granted    he wants to dispose of her husband that too we grant though if mrs clayton is in love with him and they are having the affair together where is the urgency it is perhaps that mr clayton will not give his wife the divorce but it is not of all this that i talk major rich he is a retired soldier and it is said sometimes that soldiers are not brainy but tout de mme this major rich is he can he be a complete imbecile miss lemon did not reply she took this to be a purely rhetorical question well demanded poirot what do you think about it all what do i think miss lemon was startled mais oui you miss lemon adjusted her mind to the strain put upon it she was not given to mental speculation of any kind unless asked for it in such leisure moments as she had her mind was filled with the details of a superlatively perfect filing system it was her only mental recreation well  she began and paused tell me just what happened what you think happened on that evening mr clayton is in the sitting room writing a note major rich comes back what then he finds mr clayton there they i suppose they have a quarrel major rich stabs him then when he sees what he has done he he puts the body in the chest after all the guests i suppose might be arriving any minute yes yes the guests arrive the body is in the chest the evening passes the guests depart and then  well then i suppose major rich goes to bed and oh ah said poirot you see it now you have murdered a man you have concealed his body in a chest and then you go peacefully to bed quite unperturbed by the fact that your valet will discover the crime in the morning i suppose its possible that the valet might never have looked inside the chest with an enormous pool of blood on the carpet underneath it perhaps major rich didnt realize that the blood was there was it not somewhat careless of him not to look and see i dare say he was upset said miss lemon poirot threw up his hands in despair miss lemon seized the opportunity to hurry from the room the mystery of the spanish chest was strictly speaking no business of poirots he was engaged at the moment in a delicate mission for one of the large oil companies where one of the high ups was possibly involved in some questionable transaction it was hush hush important and exceedingly lucrative it was sufficiently involved to command poirots attention and had the great advantage that it required very little physical activity it was sophisticated and bloodless crime at the highest levels the mystery of the spanish chest was dramatic and emotional two qualities which poirot had often declared to hastings could be much overrated and indeed frequently were so by the latter he had been severe with ce cher hastings on this point and now here he was behaving much as his friend might have done obsessed with beautiful women crimes of passion jealousy hatred and all the other romantic causes of murder he wanted to know about it all he wanted to know what major rich was like and what his manservant burgess was like and what margharita clayton was like though that he thought he knew and what the late arnold clayton had been like since he held that the character of the victim was of the first importance in a murder case and even what commander mclaren the faithful friend and mr and mrs spence the recently acquired acquaintances were like and he did not see exactly how he was going to gratify his curiosity he reflected on the matter later in the day why did the whole business intrigue him so much he decided after reflection that it was because as the facts were related the whole thing was more or less impossible yes there was a euclidean flavour starting from what one could accept there had been a quarrel between two men cause presumably a woman one man killed the other in the heat of rage yes that happened though it would be more acceptable if the husband had killed the lover still the lover had killed the husband stabbed him with a dagger  somehow a rather unlikely weapon perhaps major rich had had an italian mother somewhere surely there should be something to explain the choice of a dagger as a weapon anyway one must accept the dagger some papers called it a stiletto it was to hand and was used the body was concealed in the chest that was common sense and inevitable the crime had not been premeditated and as the valet was returning at any moment and four guests would be arriving before very long it seemed the only course indicated the party is held the guests depart the manservant is already gone and major rich goes to bed to understand how that could happen one must see major rich and find out what kind of a man acts in that way could it be that overcome with horror at what he had done and the long strain of an evening trying to appear his normal self he had taken a sleeping pill of some kind or a tranquillizer which had put him into a heavy slumber which lasted long beyond his usual hour of waking possible or was it a case rewarding to a psychologist where major richs feeling of subconscious guilt made him want the crime to be discovered to make up ones mind on that point one would have to see major rich it all came back to  the telephone rang poirot it ring for some moments until he realized that miss lemon after bringing him his letters to sign had gone home some time ago and that george had probably gone out he picked up the receiver m poirot speaking oh how splendid poirot blinked slightly at the fervour of the charming female voice its abbie chatterton ah lady chatterton how can i serve you by coming over as quickly as you can right away to a simply frightful cocktail party i am giving not just for the cocktail party its for something quite different really i need you its absolutely vital please please please dont let me down dont say you cant manage it poirot had not been going to say anything of the kind lord chatterton apart from being a peer of the realm and occasionally making a very dull speech in the house of lords was nobody in particular but lady chatterton was one of the brightest jewels in what poirot called le haut monde everything she did or said was news she had brains beauty originality and enough vitality to activate a rocket to the moon she said again i need you just give that wonderful moustache of yours a lovely twirl and come it was not quite so quick as that poirot had first to make a meticulous toilet the twirl to the moustaches was added and he then set off the door of lady chattertons delightful house in cheriton street was ajar and a noise as of animals mutinying at the zoo sounded from within lady chatterton who was holding two ambassadors an international rugger player and an american evangelist in play neatly jettisoned them with the rapidity of sleight of hand and was at poirots side m poirot how wonderful to see you no dont have that nasty martini ive got something special for you a kind of sirop that the sheikhs drink in morocco its in my own little room upstairs she led the way upstairs and poirot followed her she paused to say over her shoulder i didnt put these people off because its absolutely essential that no one should know theres anything special going on here and ive promised the servants enormous bonuses if not a word leaks out after all one doesnt want ones house besieged by reporters and poor darling shes been through so much already lady chatterton did not stop at the first floor landing instead she swept on up to the floor above gasping for breath and somewhat bewildered hercule poirot followed lady chatterton paused gave a rapid glance downwards over the banisters and then flung open a door exclaiming as she did so ive got him margharita ive got him here he is she stood aside in triumph to let poirot enter then performed a rapid introduction this is margharita clayton shes a very very dear friend of mine youll help her wont you margharita this is that wonderful hercule poirot hell do just everything you want you will wont you dear m poirot and without waiting for the answer which she obviously took for granted lady chatterton had not been a spoilt beauty all her life for nothing she dashed out of the door and down the stairs calling back rather indiscreetly ive got to go back to all these awful people    the woman who had been sitting in a chair by the window rose and came towards him he would have recognized her even if lady chatterton had not mentioned her name here was that wide that very wide brow the dark hair that sprang away from it like wings the grey eyes set far apart she wore a close fitting high necked gown of dull black that showed up the beauty of her body and the magnolia whiteness of her skin it was an unusual face rather than a beautiful one one of those oddly proportioned faces that one sometimes sees in an italian primitive there was about her a kind of medieval simplicity a strange innocence that could be poirot thought more devastating than any voluptuous sophistication when she spoke it was with a kind of childlike candour abbie says you will help me    she looked at him gravely and inquiringly for a moment he stood quite still scrutinizing her closely there was nothing ill bred in his manner of doing it it was more the kind but searching look that a famous consultant gives a new patient are you sure madame he said at last that i can help you a little flush rose to her cheeks i dont know what you mean what is it madame that you want me to do oh she seemed surprised i thought you knew who i was i know who you are your husband was killed stabbed and a major rich has been arrested and charged with his murder the flush heightened major rich did not kill my husband quick as a flash poirot said why not she stared puzzled i i beg your pardon i have confused you because i have not asked the question that everybody asks the police the lawyers    why should major rich kill arnold clayton but i ask the opposite i ask you madame why you are sure that major rich did not kill him because she paused a moment because i know major rich so well you know major rich so well repeated poirot tonelessly he paused and then said sharply how well whether she understood his meaning he could not guess he thought to himself here is either a woman of great simplicity or of great subtlety    many people he thought must have wondered that about margharita clayton    how well she was looking at him doubtfully five years no nearly six that was not precisely what i meant    you must understand madame that i shall have to ask you the impertinent questions perhaps you will speak the truth perhaps you will lie it is very necessary for a woman to lie sometimes women must defend themselves and the lie it can be a good weapon but there are three people madame to whom a woman should speak the truth to her father confessor to her hairdresser and to her private detective if she trusts him do you trust me madame margharita clayton drew a deep breath yes she said i do and added i must very well then what is it you want me to do find out who killed your husband i suppose so yes but it is not essential you want me then to clear major rich from suspicion she nodded quickly gratefully that and that only it was he saw an unnecessary question margharita clayton was a woman who saw only one thing at a time and now he said for the impertinence you and major rich you are lovers yes do you mean were we having an affair together no but he was in love with you yes and you were in love with him i think so you do not seem quite sure i am sure now ah you did not then love your husband no you reply with an admirable simplicity most women would wish to explain at great length just exactly what their feelings were how long had you been married eleven years can you tell me a little about your husband what kind of a man he was she frowned its difficult i dont really know what kind of a man arnold was he was very quiet very reserved one didnt know what he was thinking he was clever of course everyone said he was brilliant in his work i mean    he didnt how can i put it he never explained himself at all    was he in love with you oh yes he must have been or he wouldnt have minded so much  she came to a sudden stop about other men that is what you were going to say he was jealous again she said he must have been and then as though feeling that the phrase needed explanation she went on sometimes for days he wouldnt speak    poirot nodded thoughtfully this violence that has come into your life is it the first that you have known violence she frowned then flushed is it do you mean that poor boy who shot himself yes said poirot i expect that is what i mean id no idea he felt like that    i was sorry for him he seemed so shy so lonely he must have been very neurotic i think and there were two italians a duel it was ridiculous anyway nobody was killed thank goodness    and honestly i didnt care about either of them i never even pretended to care no you were just there and where you are things happen i have seen that before in my life it is because you do not care that men are driven mad but for major rich you do care so we must do what we can    he was silent for a moment or two she sat there gravely watching him we turn from personalities which are often the really important things to plain facts i know only what has been in the papers on the facts as given there only two persons had the opportunity of killing your husband only two persons could have killed him major rich and major richs manservant she said stubbornly i know charles didnt kill him so then it must have been the valet you agree she said doubtfully i see what you mean    but you are dubious about it it just seems fantastic yet the possibility is there your husband undoubtedly came to the flat since his body was found there if the valets story is true major rich killed him but if the valets story is false then the valet killed him and hid the body in the chest before his master returned an excellent way of disposing of the body from his point of view he has only got to notice the bloodstain the next morning and discover it suspicion will immediately fall on rich but why should he want to kill arnold ah why the motive cannot be an obvious one or the police would have investigated it it is possible that your husband knew something to the valets discredit and was about to acquaint major rich with the facts did your husband ever say anything to you about this man burgess she shook her head do you think he would have done so if that had indeed been the case she frowned its difficult to say possibly not arnold never talked much about people i told you he was reserved he wasnt he was never a chatty man he was a man who kept his own counsel    yes now what is your opinion of burgess hes not the kind of man you notice very much a fairly good servant adequate but not polished what age about thirty seven or eight i should think hed been a batman in the army during the war but he wasnt a regular soldier how long had he been with major rich not very long about a year and a half i think you never noticed anything odd about his manner towards your husband we werent there so very often no i noticed nothing at all tell me now about the events of that evening what time were you invited eight fifteen for half past and just what kind of a party was it to be well there would be drinks and a kind of buffet supper usually a very good one foie gras and hot toast smoked salmon sometimes there was a hot rice dish charles had a special recipe hed got in the near east but that was more for winter then we used to have music charles had got a very good stereophonic gramophone both my husband and jock mclaren were very fond of classical records and we had dance music the spences were very keen dancers it was that sort of thing a quiet informal evening charles was a very good host and this particular evening it was like other evenings there you noticed nothing unusual nothing out of place out of place she frowned for a moment when you said that i no its gone there was something    she shook her head again no to answer your question there was nothing unusual at all about that evening we enjoyed ourselves everybody seemed relaxed and happy she shivered and to think that all the time  poirot held up a quick hand do not think this business that took your husband to scotland how much do you know about that not very much there was some dispute over the restrictions on selling a piece of land which belonged to my husband the sale had apparently gone through and then some sudden snag turned up what did your husband tell you exactly he came in with a telegram in his hand as far as i remember he said this is most annoying i shall have to take the night mail to edinburgh and see johnston first thing tomorrow morning    too bad when one thought the thing was going through smoothly at last then he said shall i ring up jock and get him to call for you and i said nonsense ill just take a taxi and he said that jock or the spences would see me home i said did he want anything packed and he said hed just throw a few things into a bag and have a quick snack at the club before catching the train then he went off and and thats the last time i saw him her voice broke a little on the last words poirot looked at her very hard did he show you the telegram no a pity why do you say that he did not answer that question instead he said briskly now to business who are the solicitors acting for major rich she told him and he made a note of the address will you write a few words to them and give it to me i shall want to make arrangements to see major rich he its been remanded for a week naturally that is the procedure will you also write a note to commander mclaren and to your friends the spences i shall want to see all of them and it is essential that they do not at once show me the door when she rose from the writing desk he said one thing more i shall register my own impressions but i also want yours of commander mclaren and of mr and mrs spence jock is one of our oldest friends ive known him ever since i was a child he appears to be quite a dour person but hes really a dear always the same always to be relied upon hes not gay and amusing but hes a tower of strength both arnold and i relied on his judgement a lot and he also is doubtless in love with you poirots eyes twinkled slightly oh yes said margharita happily hes always been in love with me but by now its become a kind of habit and the spences theyre amusing and very good company linda spence is really rather a clever girl arnold enjoyed talking with her shes attractive too you are friends she and i in a way i dont know that i really like her shes too malicious and her husband oh jeremy is delightful very musical knows a good deal about pictures too he and i go to picture shows a good deal together    ah well i shall see for myself he took her hand in his i hope madame you will not regret asking for my help why should i regret it her eyes opened wide one never knows said poirot cryptically and i i do not know he said to himself as he went down the stairs the cocktail party was still in full spate but he avoided being captured and reached the street no he repeated i do not know it was of margharita clayton he was thinking that apparently childlike candour that frank innocence was it just that or did it mask something else there had been women like that in medieval days women on whom history had not been able to agree he thought of mary stuart the scottish queen had she known that night in kirk o fields of the deed that was to be done or was she completely innocent had the conspirators told her nothing was she one of those childlike simple women who can say to themselves i do not know and believe it he felt the spell of margharita clayton but he was not entirely sure about her    such women could be though innocent themselves the cause of crimes such women could be in intent and design criminals themselves though not in action theirs was never the hand that held the knife  as to margharita clayton no he did not know hercule poirot did not find major richs solicitors very helpful he had not expected to do so they managed to indicate though without saying so that it would be in their clients best interest if mrs clayton showed no sign of activity on his behalf his visit to them was in the interests of correctness he had enough pull with the home office and the cid to arrange his interview with the prisoner inspector miller who was in charge of the clayton case was not one of poirots favourites he was not however hostile on this occasion merely contemptuous cant waste much time over the old dodderer he had said to his assisting sergeant before poirot was shown in still ill have to be polite youll really have to pull some rabbits out of a hat if youre going to do anything with this one m poirot he remarked cheerfully nobody else but rich could have killed the bloke except the valet oh ill give you the valet as a possibility that is but you wont find anything there no motives whatever you cannot be entirely sure of that motives are very curious things well he wasnt acquainted with clayton in any way hes got a perfectly innocuous past and he seems to be perfectly right in his head i dont know what more you want i want to find out that rich did not commit the crime to please the lady eh inspector miller grinned wickedly shes been getting at you i suppose quite something isnt she cherchez la femme with a vengeance if shed had the opportunity you know she might have done it herself that no youd be surprised i once knew a woman like that put a couple of husbands out of the way without a blink of her innocent blue eyes brokenhearted each time too the jury would have acquitted her if theyd had half a chance which they hadnt the evidence being practically cast iron well my friend let us not argue what i make so bold as to ask is a few reliable details on the facts what a newspaper prints is news but not always truth they have to enjoy themselves what do you want time of death as near as can be which cant be very near because the body wasnt examined until the following morning death is estimated to have taken place from thirteen to ten hours previously that is between seven and ten oclock the night before    he was stabbed through the jugular vein death must have been a matter of moments and the weapon a kind of italian stiletto quite small razor sharp nobody has ever seen it before or knows where it comes from but we shall know in the end    its a matter of time and patience it could not have been picked up in the course of a quarrel no the valet says no such thing was in the flat what interests me is the telegram said poirot the telegram that called arnold clayton away to scotland    was that summons genuine no there was no hitch or trouble up there the land transfer or whatever it was was proceeding normally then who sent that telegram i am presuming there was a telegram there must have been    not that wed necessarily believe mrs clayton but clayton told the valet he was called by wire to scotland and he also told commander mclaren what time did he see commander mclaren they had a snack together at their club combined services that was at about a quarter past seven then clayton took a taxi to richs flat arriving there just before eight oclock after that  miller spread his hands out anybody notice anything at all odd about richs manner that evening oh well you know what people are once a thing has happened people think they noticed a lot of things i bet they never saw at all mrs spence now she says he was distrait all the evening didnt always answer to the point as though he had something on his mind i bet he had too if he had a body in the chest wondering how the hell to get rid of it why didnt he get rid of it beats me lost his nerve perhaps but it was madness to leave it until next day he had the best chance hed ever have that night theres no night porter on he could have got his car round packed the body in the boot its a big boot driven out in the country and parked it somewhere he might have been seen getting the body into the car but the flats are in a side street and theres a courtyard you drive a car through at say three in the morning he had a reasonable chance and what does he do goes to bed sleeps late the next morning and wakes up to find the police in the flat he went to bed and slept well as an innocent man might do have it that way if you like but do you really believe that yourself i shall have to leave that question until i have seen the man myself think you know an innocent man when you see one its not so easy as that i know it is not easy and i should not attempt to say i could do it what i want to make up my mind about is whether the man is as stupid as he seems to be poirot had no intention of seeing charles rich until he had seen everyone else he started with commander mclaren mclaren was a tall swarthy uncommunicative man he had a rugged but pleasant face he was a shy man and not easy to talk to but poirot persevered fingering margharitas note mclaren said almost reluctantly well if margharita wants me to tell you all i can of course ill do so dont know what there is to tell though youve heard it all already but whatever margharita wants ive always done what she wanted ever since she was sixteen shes got a way with her you know i know said poirot he went on first i should like you to answer a question quite frankly do you think major rich is guilty yes i do i wouldnt say so to margharita if she wants to think hes innocent but i simply cant see it any other way hang it all the fellows got to be guilty was there bad feeling between him and mr clayton not in the least arnold and charles were the best of friends thats what makes the whole thing so extraordinary perhaps major richs friendship with mrs clayton  he was interrupted faugh all that stuff all the papers slyly hinting at it    damned innuendoes mrs clayton and rich were good friends and thats all margharitas got lots of friends im her friend been one for years and nothing the whole world mightnt know about it same with charles and margharita you do not then consider that they were having an affair together certainly not mclaren was wrathful dont go listening to that hell cat spence woman shed say anything but perhaps mr clayton suspected there might be something between his wife and major rich you can take it from me he did nothing of the sort id have known if so arnold and i were very close what sort of man was he you if anyone should know well arnold was a quiet sort of chap but he was clever quite brilliant i believe what they call a first class financial brain he was quite high up in the treasury you know so i have heard he read a good deal and he collected stamps and he was extremely fond of music he didnt dance or care much for going out was it do you think a happy marriage commander mclarens answer did not come quickly he seemed to be puzzling it out that sort of things very hard to say    yes i think they were happy he was devoted to her in his quiet way im sure she was fond of him they werent likely to split up if thats what youre thinking they hadnt perhaps a lot in common poirot nodded it was as much as he was likely to get he said now tell me about that last evening mr clayton dined with you at the club what did he say told me hed got to go to scotland seemed vexed about it we didnt have dinner by the way no time just sandwiches and a drink for him that is i only had the drink i was going out to a buffet supper remember mr clayton mentioned a telegram yes he did not actually show you the telegram no did he say he was going to call on rich not definitely in fact he said he doubted if hed have time he said margharita can explain or you can and then he said see she gets home all right wont you then he went off it was all quite natural and easy he had no suspicion at all that the telegram wasnt genuine wasnt it commander mclaren looked startled apparently not how very odd    commander mclaren went into a kind of coma emerging suddenly to say but that really is odd i mean whats the point why should anybody want him to go to scotland it is a question that needs answering certainly hercule poirot left leaving the commander apparently still puzzling on the matter the spences lived in a minute house in chelsea linda spence received poirot with the utmost delight do tell me she said tell me all about margharita where is she that i am not at liberty to state madame she has hidden herself well margharita is very clever at that sort of thing but shell be called to give evidence at the trial i suppose she cant wiggle herself out of that poirot looked at her appraisingly he decided grudgingly that she was attractive in the modern style which at that moment resembled an underfed orphan child it was not a type he admired the artistically disordered hair fluffed out round her head a pair of shrewd eyes watched him from a slightly dirty face devoid of make up save for a vivid cerise mouth she wore an enormous pale yellow sweater hanging almost to her knees and tight black trousers whats your part in all this demanded mrs spence get the boyfriend out of it somehow is that it what a hope you think then that he is guilty of course who else that poirot thought was very much the question he parried it by asking another question what did major rich seem to you like on that fatal evening as usual or not as usual linda spence screwed up her eyes judicially no he wasnt himself he was different how different well surely if youve just stabbed a man in cold blood  but you were not aware at the time that he had just stabbed a man in cold blood were you no of course not so how did you account for his being different in what way well distrait oh i dont know but thinking it over afterwards i decided that there had definitely been something poirot sighed who arrived first we did jim and i and then jock and finally margharita when was mr claytons departure for scotland first mentioned when margharita came she said to charles arnolds terribly sorry hes had to rush off to edinburgh by the night train and charles said oh thats too bad and then jock said sorry thought you already knew and then we had drinks major rich at no time mentioned seeing mr clayton that evening he said nothing of his having called in on his way to the station not that i heard it was strange was it not said poirot about that telegram what was strange it was a fake nobody in edinburgh knows anything about it so thats it i wondered at the time you have an idea about the telegram i should say it rather leaps to the eye how do you mean exactly my dear man said linda dont play the innocent unknown hoaxer gets the husband out of the way for that night at all events the coast is clear you mean that major rich and mrs clayton planned to spend the night together you have heard of such things havent you linda looked amused and the telegram was sent by one or the other of them it wouldnt surprise me major rich and mrs clayton were having an affair together you think lets say i shouldnt be surprised if they were i dont know it for a fact did mr clayton suspect arnold was an extraordinary person he was all bottled up if you know what i mean i think he did know but he was the kind of man who would never have let on anyone would think he was a dry stick with no feelings at all but im pretty sure he wasnt like that underneath the queer thing is that i should have been much less surprised if arnold had stabbed charles than the other way about ive an idea arnold was really an insanely jealous person that is interesting though its more likely really that hed have done in margharita othello that sort of thing margharita you know had an extraordinary effect on men she is a good looking woman said poirot with judicious understatement it was more than that she had something she would get men all her up mad about her and turn round and look at them with a sort of wide eyed surprise that drove them barmy une femme fatale thats probably the foreign name for it you know her well my dear shes one of my best friends and i wouldnt trust her an inch ah said poirot and shifted the subject to commander mclaren jock old faithful hes a pet born to be the friend of the family he and arnold were really close friends i think arnold unbent to him more than to anyone else and of course he was margharitas tame cat hed been devoted to her for years and was mr clayton jealous of him too jealous of jock what an idea margharitas genuinely fond of jock but shes never given him a thought of that kind i dont think really that one ever would    i dont know why    it seems a shame hes so nice poirot switched to consideration of the valet but beyond saying vaguely that he mixed a very good side car linda spence seemed to have no ideas about burgess and indeed seemed barely to have noticed him but she was quite quick in the uptake youre thinking i suppose that he could have killed arnold just as easily as charles could it seems to me madly unlikely that remark depresses me madame but then it seems to me though you will probably not agree that it is madly unlikely not that major rich should kill arnold clayton but that he should kill him in just the way he did stiletto stuff yes definitely not in character more likely the blunt instrument or he might have strangled him perhaps poirot sighed we are back at othello yes othello    you have given me there a little idea    have i what  there was the sound of a latchkey and an opening door oh heres jeremy do you want to talk to him too jeremy spence was a pleasant looking man of thirty odd well groomed and almost ostentatiously discreet mrs spence said that she had better go and have a look at a casserole in the kitchen and went off leaving the two men together jeremy spence displayed none of the engaging candour of his wife he was clearly disliking very much being mixed up in the case at all and his remarks were carefully noninformative they had known the claytons some time rich not so well had seemed a pleasant fellow as far as he could remember rich had seemed absolutely as usual on the evening in question clayton and rich always seemed on good terms the whole thing seemed quite unaccountable throughout the conversation jeremy spence was making it clear that he expected poirot to take his departure he was civil but only just so i am afraid said poirot that you do not like these questions well weve had quite a session of this with the police i rather feel thats enough weve told all we know or saw now id like to forget it you have my sympathy it is most unpleasant to be mixed up in this to be asked not only what you know or what you saw but perhaps even what you think best not to think but can one avoid it do you think for instance that mrs clayton was in it too did she plan the death of her husband with rich good lord no spence sounded shocked and dismayed id no idea that there was any question of such a thing has your wife not suggested such a possibility oh linda you know what women are always got their knife into each other margharita never gets much of a show from her own sex a darned sight too attractive but surely this theory about rich and margharita planning murder thats fantastic such things have been known the weapon for instance it is the kind of weapon a woman might possess rather than a man do you mean the police have traced it to her they cant have i mean  i know nothing said poirot truthfully and escaped hastily from the consternation on spences face he judged that he had left that gentleman something to think about you will forgive my saying m poirot that i cannot see how you can be of assistance to me in any way poirot did not answer he was looking thoughtfully at the man who had been charged with the murder of his friend arnold clayton he was looking at the firm jaw the narrow head a lean brown man athletic and sinewy something of the greyhound about him a man whose face gave nothing away and who was receiving his visitor with a marked lack of cordiality i quite understand that mrs clayton sent you to see me with the best intentions but quite frankly i think she was unwise unwise both for her own sake and mine you mean rich gave a nervous glance over his shoulder but the attendant warder was the regulation distance away rich lowered his voice theyve got to find a motive for this ridiculous accusation theyll try to bring that there was an association between mrs clayton and myself that as i know mrs clayton will have told you is quite untrue we are friends nothing more but surely it is advisable that she should make no move on my behalf hercule poirot ignored the point instead he picked out a word you said this ridiculous accusation but it is not that you know i did not kill arnold clayton call it then a false accusation say the accusation is not true but it is not ridiculous on the contrary it is highly plausible you must know that very well i can only tell you that to me it seems fantastic saying that will be of very little use to you we must think of something more useful than that i am represented by solicitors they have briefed i understand eminent counsel to appear for my defence i cannot accept your use of the word we  unexpectedly poirot smiled ah he said in his most foreign manner that is the flea in the ear you give me very well i go i wanted to see you i have seen you already i have looked up your career you passed high up into sandhurst you passed into the staff college and so on and so on i have made my own judgement of you today you are not a stupid man and what has all that got to do with it everything it is impossible that a man of your ability should commit a murder in the way this one was committed very well you are innocent tell me now about your manservant burgess burgess yes if you didnt kill clayton burgess must have done so the conclusion seems inescapable but why there must be a why you are the only person who knows burgess well enough to make a guess at it why major rich why i cant imagine i simply cant see it oh ive followed the same line of reasoning as you have yes burgess had opportunity the only person who had except myself the trouble is i just cant believe it burgess is not the sort of man you can imagine murdering anybody what do your legal advisers think richs lips set in a grim line my legal advisers spend their time asking me in a persuasive way if it isnt true that i have suffered all my life from blackouts when i dont really know what i am doing as bad as that said poirot well perhaps we shall find it is burgess who is subject to blackouts it is always an idea the weapon now they showed it to you and asked you if it was yours it was not mine i had never seen it before it was not yours no but are you quite sure you had never seen it before no was there a faint hesitation its a kind of ornamental toy really one sees things like that lying about in peoples houses in a womans drawing room perhaps perhaps in mrs claytons drawing room certainly not the last word came out loudly and the warder looked up trs bien certainly not and there is no need to shout but somewhere at some time you have seen something very like it eh i am right i do not think so    in some curio shop    perhaps ah very likely poirot rose i take my leave and now said hercule poirot for burgess yes at long last for burgess he had learnt something about the people in the case from themselves and from each other but nobody had given him any knowledge of burgess no clue no hint of what kind of a man he was when he saw burgess he realized why the valet was waiting for him at major richs flat apprised of his arrival by a telephone call from commander mclaren i am m hercule poirot yes sir i was expecting you burgess held back the door with a deferential hand and poirot entered a small square entrance hall a door on the left open leading into the sitting room burgess relieved poirot of his hat and coat and followed him into the sitting room ah said poirot looking round it was here then that it happened yes sir a quiet fellow burgess white faced a little weedy awkward shoulders and elbows a flat voice with a provincial accent that poirot did not know from the east coast perhaps rather a nervous man perhaps but otherwise no definite characteristics it was hard to associate him with positive action of any kind could one postulate a negative killer he had those pale blue rather shifty eyes that unobservant people often equate with dishonesty yet a liar can look you in the face with a bold and confident eye what is happening to the flat poirot inquired im still looking after it sir major rich arranged for my pay and to keep it nice until until  the eyes shifted uncomfortably until  agreed poirot he added in a matter of fact manner i should say that major rich will almost certainly be committed for trial the case will come up probably within three months burgess shook his head not in denial simply in perplexity it really doesnt seem possible he said that major rich should be a murderer the whole thing that chest  his eyes went across the room ah so that is the famous chest it was a mammoth piece of furniture of very dark polished wood studded with brass with a great brass hasp and antique lock a handsome affair poirot went over to it it stood against the wall near the window next to a modern cabinet for holding records on the other side of it was a door half ajar the door was partly masked by a big painted leather screen that leads into major richs bedroom said burgess poirot nodded his eyes travelled to the other side of the room there were two stereophonic record players each on a low table trailing cords of snakelike flex there were easy chairs a big table on the walls were a set of japanese prints it was a handsome room comfortable but not luxurious he looked back at william burgess the discovery he said kindly must have been a great shock to you oh it was sir ill never forget it the valet rushed into speech words poured from him he felt perhaps that by telling the story often enough he might at last expunge it from his mind id gone round the room sir clearing up glasses and so on id just stooped to pick up a couple of olives off the floor and i saw it on the rug a rusty dark stain no the rugs gone now to the cleaners the police had done with it whatevers that i thought saying to myself almost in joke like really it might be blood but where does it come from what got spilt and then i saw it was from the chest down the side here where theres a crack and i said still not thinking anything well whatever  and i lifted up the lid like this he suited the action to the word and there it was the body of a man lying on his side doubled up like he might be asleep and that nasty foreign knife or dagger thing sticking up out of his neck ill never forget it never not as long as i live the shock not expecting it you understand    he breathed deeply i let the lid fall and i ran out of the flat and down to the street looking for a policeman and lucky i found one just round the corner poirot regarded him reflectively the performance if it was a performance was very good he began to be afraid that it was not a performance that it was just how things had happened you did not think of awakening first major rich he asked it never occurred to me sir what with the shock i i just wanted to get out of here  he swallowed and and get help poirot nodded did you realize that it was mr clayton he asked i ought to have sir but you know i dont believe i did of course as soon as i got back with the police officer i said why its mr clayton and he says whos mr clayton and i says he was here last night  ah said poirot last night    do you remember exactly when it was mr clayton arrived here not to the minute but as near as not a quarter to eight id say    you knew him well he and mrs clayton had been here quite frequently during the year and a half ive been employed here did he seem quite as usual i think so a little out of breath but i took it hed been hurrying he was catching a train or so he said he had a bag with him i suppose as he was going to scotland no sir i imagine he was keeping a taxi down below was he disappointed to find that major rich was out not to notice just said hed scribble a note he came in here and went over to the desk and i went back to the kitchen i was a little behindhand with the anchovy eggs the kitchens at the end of the passage and you dont hear very well from there i didnt hear him go out or the master come in but then i wouldnt expect to and the next thing major rich called me he was standing in the door here he said hed forgotten mrs spences turkish cigarettes i was to hurry out and get them so i did i brought them back and put them on the table in here of course i took it that mr clayton had left by then to get his train and nobody else came to the flat during the time major rich was out and you were in the kitchen no sir no one can you be sure of that how could anyone sir theyd have had to ring the bell poirot shook his head how could anyone the spences and mclaren and also mrs clayton could he already knew account for every minute of their time mclaren had been with acquaintances at the club the spences had had a couple of friends in for a drink before starting margharita clayton had talked to a friend on the telephone at just that period not that he thought of any of them as possibilities there would have been better ways of killing arnold clayton than following him to a flat with a manservant there and the host returning any moment no he had had a last minute hope of a mysterious stranger someone out of claytons apparently impeccable past recognizing him in the street following him here attacking him with the stiletto thrusting the body into the chest and fleeing pure melodrama unrelated to reason or to probabilities in tune with romantic historical fictions matching the spanish chest he went back across the room to the chest he raised the lid it came up easily noiselessly in a faint voice burgess said its been scrubbed out sir i saw to that poirot bent over it with a faint exclamation he bent lower he explored with his fingers these holes at the back and one side they look they feel as though they had been made quite recently holes sir the valet bent to see i really couldnt say ive never noticed them particularly they are not very obvious but they are there what is their purpose would you say i really wouldnt know sir some animal perhaps i mean a beetle something of that kind something that gnaws wood some animal said poirot i wonder he stepped back across the room when you came in here with the cigarettes was there anything at all about this room that looked different anything at all chairs moved table something of that kind its odd your saying that sir    now you come to mention it there was that screen there that cuts off the draught from the bedroom door it was moved over a bit more to the left like this poirot moved swiftly a little more still    thats right the screen had already masked about half of the chest the way it was now arranged it almost hid the chest altogether why did you think it had been moved i didnt think sir another miss lemon burgess added doubtfully i suppose it leaves the way into the bedroom clearer if the ladies wanted to leave their wraps perhaps but there might be another reason burgess looked inquiring the screen hides the chest now and it hides the rug below the chest if major rich stabbed mr clayton blood would presently start dripping through the cracks at the base of the chest someone might notice as you noticed the next morning so the screen was moved i never thought of that sir what are the lights like here strong or dim ill show you sir quickly the valet drew the curtains and switched on a couple of lamps they gave a soft mellow light hardly strong enough even to read by poirot glanced up at a ceiling light that wasnt on sir its very little used poirot looked round in the soft glow the valet said i dont believe youd see any bloodstains sir its too dim i think you are right so then why was the screen moved burgess shivered its awful to think of a nice gentleman like major rich doing a thing like that youve no doubt that he did do it why did he do it burgess well hed been through the war of course he might have had a head wound mightnt he they do say as sometimes it all flares up years afterwards they suddenly go all queer and dont know what theyre doing and they say as often as not its their nearest and dearest as they goes for do you think it could have been like that poirot gazed at him he sighed he turned away no he said it was not like that with the air of a conjuror a piece of crisp paper was insinuated into burgesss hand oh thank you sir but really i dont  you have helped me said poirot by showing me this room by showing me what is in the room by showing me what took place that evening the impossible is never impossible remember that i said that there were only two possibilities i was wrong there is a third possibility he looked round the room again and gave a little shiver pull back the curtains let in the light and the air this room needs it it needs cleansing it will be a long time i think before it is purified from what afflicts it the lingering memory of hate burgess his mouth open handed poirot his hat and coat he seemed bewildered poirot who enjoyed making incomprehensible statements went down to the street with a brisk step when poirot got home he made a telephone call to inspector miller what happened to claytons bag his wife said he had packed one it was at the club he left it with the porter then he must have forgotten it and gone off without it what was in it what youd expect pyjamas extra shirt washing things very thorough what did you expect would be in it poirot ignored that question he said about the stiletto i suggest that you get hold of whatever cleaning woman attends mrs spences house find out if she ever saw anything like it lying about there mrs spence miller whistled is that the way your mind is working the spences were shown the stiletto they didnt recognize it ask them again do you mean  and then let me know what they say  i cant imagine what you think you have got hold of read othello miller consider the characters in othello weve missed out one of them he rang off next he dialled lady chatterton the number was engaged he tried again a little later still no success he called for george his valet and instructed him to continue ringing the number until he got a reply lady chatterton he knew was an incorrigible telephoner he sat down in a chair carefully eased off his patent leather shoes stretched his toes and leaned back i am old said hercule poirot i tire easily    he brightened but the cells they still function slowly but they function    othello yes who was it said that to me ah yes mrs spence the bag    the screen    the body lying there like a man asleep a clever murder premeditated planned    i think enjoyed    george announced to him that lady chatterton was on the line hercule poirot here madame may i speak to your guest why of course oh m poirot have you done something wonderful not yet said poirot but possibly it marches presently margharitas voice quiet gentle madame when i asked you if you noticed anything out of place that evening at the party you frowned as though you remembered something and then it escaped you would it have been the position of the screen that night the screen why of course yes it was not quite in its usual place did you dance that night part of the time who did you dance with mostly jeremy spence hes a wonderful dancer charles is good but not spectacular he and linda danced and now and then we changed jock mclaren doesnt dance he got out the records and sorted them and arranged what wed have you had serious music later yes there was a pause then margharita said m poirot what is all this have you is there hope do you ever know madame what the people around you are feeling her voice faintly surprised said i suppose so i suppose not i think you have no idea i think that is the tragedy of your life but the tragedy is for other people not for you someone today mentioned to me othello i asked you if your husband was jealous and you said you thought he must be but you said it quite lightly you said it as desdemona might have said it not realizing danger she too recognized jealousy but she did not understand it because she herself never had and never could experience jealousy she was i think quite unaware of the force of acute physical passion she loved her husband with the romantic fervour of hero worship she loved her friend cassio quite innocently as a close companion    i think that because of her immunity to passion she herself drove men mad    am i making sense to you madame there was a pause and then margharitas voice answered cool sweet a little bewildered i dont i dont really understand what you are saying    poirot sighed he spoke in matter of fact tones this evening he said i pay you a visit inspector miller was not an easy man to persuade but equally hercule poirot was not an easy man to shake off until he had got his way inspector miller grumbled but capitulated  though what lady chattertons got to do with this  nothing really she has provided asylum for a friend that is all about those spences how did you know that stiletto came from there it was a mere guess something jeremy spence said gave me the idea i suggested that the stiletto belonged to margharita clayton he showed that he knew positively that it did not he paused what did they say he asked with some curiosity admitted that it was very like a toy dagger theyd once had but it had been mislaid some weeks ago and they had really forgotten about it i suppose rich pinched it from there a man who likes to play safe mr jeremy spence said hercule poirot he muttered to himself some weeks ago    oh yes the planning began a long time ago eh whats that we arrive said poirot the taxi drew up at lady chattertons house in cheriton street poirot paid the fare margharita clayton was waiting for them in the room upstairs her face hardened when she saw miller i didnt know  you did not know who the friend was i proposed to bring inspector miller is not a friend of mine that rather depends on whether you want to see justice done or not mrs clayton your husband was murdered  and now we have to talk of who killed him said poirot quickly may we sit down madame slowly margharita sat down in a high backed chair facing the two men i ask said poirot addressing both his hearers to listen to me patiently i think i now know what happened on that fatal evening at major richs flat    we started all of us by an assumption that was not true the assumption that there were only two persons who had the opportunity of putting the body in the chest that is to say major rich or william burgess but we were wrong there was a third person at the flat that evening who had an equally good opportunity to do so and who was that demanded miller sceptically the lift boy no arnold clayton what concealed his own dead body youre crazy naturally not a dead body a live one in simple terms he hid himself in the chest a thing that has often been done throughout the course of history the dead bride in the misletoe bough iachimo with designs on the virtue of imogen and so on i thought of it as soon as i saw that there had been holes bored in the chest quite recently why they were made so that there might be a sufficiency of air in the chest why was the screen moved from its usual position that evening so as to hide the chest from the people in the room so that the hidden man could lift the lid from time to time and relieve his cramp and hear better what went on but why demanded margharita wide eyed with astonishment why should arnold want to hide in the chest is it you who ask that madame your husband was a jealous man he was also an inarticulate man bottled up as your friend mrs spence put it his jealousy mounted it tortured him were you or were you not richs mistress he did not know he had to know so a telegram from scotland the telegram that was never sent and that no one ever saw the overnight bag is packed and conveniently forgotten at the club he goes to the flat at a time when he has probably ascertained rich will be out he tells the valet he will write a note as soon as he is left alone he bores the holes in the chest moves the screen and climbs inside the chest tonight he will know the truth perhaps his wife will stay behind the others perhaps she will go but come back again that night the desperate jealousy racked man will know    youre not saying he stabbed himself millers voice was incredulous nonsense oh no someone else stabbed him somebody who knew he was there it was murder all right carefully planned long premeditated murder think of the other characters in othello it is iago we should have remembered subtle poisoning of arnold claytons mind hints suspicions honest iago the faithful friend the man you always believe arnold clayton believed him arnold clayton let his jealousy be played upon be roused to fever pitch was the plan of hiding in the chest arnolds own idea he may have thought it was probably he did think so and so the scene is set the stiletto quietly abstracted some weeks earlier is ready the evening comes the lights are low the gramophone is playing two couples dance the odd man out is busy at the record cabinet close to the spanish chest and its masking screen to slip behind the screen lift the lid and strike audacious but quite easy clayton would have cried out not if he were drugged said poirot according to the valet the body was lying like a man asleep clayton was asleep drugged by the only man who could have drugged him the man he had had a drink with at the club jock margharitas voice rose high in childlike surprise jock not dear old jock why ive known jock all my life why on earth should jock     poirot turned on her why did two italians fight a duel why did a young man shoot himself jock mclaren is an inarticulate man he has resigned himself perhaps to being the faithful friend to you and your husband but then comes major rich as well it is too much in the darkness of hate and desire he plans what is well nigh the perfect murder a double murder for rich is almost certain to be found guilty of it and with rich and your husband both out of the way he thinks that at last you may turn to him and perhaps madame you would have done    eh she was staring at him wide eyed horror struck    almost unconsciously she breathed perhaps    i dont know    inspector miller spoke with sudden authority this is all very well poirot its a theory nothing more theres not a shred of evidence probably not a word of it is true it is all true but theres no evidence theres nothing we can act on you are wrong i think that mclaren if this is put to him will admit it that is if it is made clear to him that margharita clayton knows    poirot paused and added because once he knows that he has lost    the perfect murder has been in vain the original version of this story the mystery of the baghdad chest can be found in the volume while the light lasts and other stories nine

bring association mrs clayton know mrs clayton told quite untrue friends nothing surely advisable make move behalf hercule poirot ignored point instead picked word said ridiculous accusation know kill

sandhurst passed staff college made judgement today stupid man got everything impossible man ability commit murder way one committed well innocent tell manservant burgess burgess yes didnt kill

THE HARLEQUIN TEA SET, mr satterthwaite clucked twice in vexation whether right in his assumption or not he was more and more convinced that cars nowadays broke down far more frequently than they used to do the only cars he trusted were old friends who had survived the test of time they had their little idiosyncrasies but you knew about those provided for them fulfilled their wants before the demand became too acute but new cars full of new gadgets different kinds of windows an instrument panel newly and differently arranged handsome in its glistening wood but being unfamiliar your groping hand hovered uneasily over fog lights windscreen wipers the choke et cetera all these things with knobs in a place you didnt expect them and when your gleaming new purchase failed in performance your local garage uttered the intensely irritating words teething troubles splendid car sir these roadsters super superbos all the latest accessories but bound to have their teething troubles you know ha ha just as though a car was a baby but mr satterthwaite being now of an advanced age was strongly of the opinion that a new car ought to be fully adult tested inspected and its teething troubles already dealt with before it came into its purchasers possession mr satterthwaite was on his way to pay a weekend visit to friends in the country his new car had already on the way from london given certain symptoms of discomfort and was now drawn up in a garage waiting for the diagnosis and how long it would take before he could resume progress towards his destination his chauffeur was in consultation with a mechanic mr satterthwaite sat striving for patience he had assured his hosts on the telephone the night before that he would be arriving in good time for tea he would reach doverton kingsbourne he assured them well before four oclock he clucked again in irritation and tried to turn his thoughts to something pleasant it was no good sitting here in a state of acute irritation frequently consulting his wristwatch clucking once more and giving he had to realize a very good imitation of a hen pleased with its prowess in laying an egg yes something pleasant yes now hadnt there been something something he had noticed as they were driving along not very long ago something that he had seen through the window which had pleased and excited him but before he had had time to think about it the cars misbehavior had become more pronounced and a rapid visit to the nearest service station had been inevitable what was it that he had seen on the left no on the right yes on the right as they drove slowly through the village street next door to a post office yes he was quite sure of that next door to a post office because the sight of the post office had given him the idea of telephoning to the addisons to break the news that he might be slightly late in his arrival the post office a village post office and next to it yes definitely next to it next door or if not next door the door after something that had stirred old memories and he had wanted just what was it that he had wanted oh dear it would come to him presently it was mixed up with a colour several colours yes a colour or colours or a word some definite word that had stirred memories thoughts pleasures gone by excitement recalling something that had been vivid and alive something in which he himself had not only seen but observed no he had done more he had taken part taken part in what and why and where all sorts of places the answer came quickly at the last thought all sorts of places on an island in corsica at monte carlo watching the croupier spinning his roulette wheel a house in the country all sorts of places and he had been there and someone else yes someone else it all tied up with that he was getting there at last if he could just    he was interrupted at that moment by the chauffeur coming to the window with the garage mechanic in tow behind him wont be long now sir the chauffeur assured mr satterthwaite cheerfully matter of ten minutes or so not more nothing seriously wrong said the mechanic in a low hoarse country voice teething troubles as you might say mr satterthwaite did not cluck this time he gnashed his own teeth a phrase he had often read in books and which in old age he seemed to have got into the habit of doing himself due perhaps to the slight looseness of his upper plate really teething trouble toothache teeth gnashing false teeth ones whole life centred he thought about teeth doverton kingsbournes only a few miles away said the chauffeur and theyve a taxi here you could go on in that sir and id bring the car along later as soon as its fixed up no said mr satterthwaite he said the word explosively and both the chauffeur and the mechanic looked startled mr satterthwaites eyes were sparkling his voice was clear and decisive memory had come to him i propose he said to walk along the road we have just come by when the car is ready you will pick me up there the harlequin cafe i think it is called its not very much of a place sir the mechanic advised that is where i shall be said mr satterthwaite speaking with a kind of regal autocracy he walked off briskly the two men stared after him dont know whats got into him said the chauffeur never seen him like that before the village of kingsbourne ducis did not live up to the old world grandeur of its name it was a smallish village consisting of one street a few houses shops that were dotted rather unevenly sometimes betraying the fact that they were houses which had been turned into shops or that they were shops which now existed as houses without any industrial intentions it was not particularly old world or beautiful it was just simple and rather unobtrusive perhaps that was why thought mr satterthwaite that a dash of brilliant colour had caught his eye ah here he was at the post office the post office was a simply functioning post office with a pillar box outside a display of some newspapers and some postcards and surely next to it yes there was the sign up above the harlequin cafe a sudden qualm struck mr satterthwaite really he was getting too old he had fancies why should that one word stir his heart the harlequin cafe the mechanic at the service station had been quite right it did not look like a place in which one would really be tempted to have a meal a snack perhaps a morning coffee then why but he suddenly realized why because the cafe or perhaps one could better put it as the house that sheltered the cafe was in two portions one side of it had small tables with chairs round them arranged ready for patrons who came here to eat but the other side was a shop a shop that sold china it was not an antique shop it had no little shelves of glass vases or mugs it was a shop that sold modern goods and the show window that gave on the street was at the present moment housing every shade of the rainbow a tea set of largish cups and saucers each one of a different colour blue red yellow green pink purple really mr satterthwaite thought a wonderful show of colour no wonder it had struck his eye as the car had passed slowly beside the pavement looking ahead for any sign of a garage or a service station it was labelled with a large card as a harlequin tea set it was the word harlequin of course which had remained fixed in mr satterthwaites mind although just far enough back in his mind so that it had been difficult to recall it the gay colours the harlequin colours and he had thought wondered had the absurd but exciting idea that in some way here was a call to him to him specially here perhaps eating a meal or purchasing cups and saucers might be his own old friend mr harley quin how many years was it since he had last seen mr quin a large number of years was it the day he had seen mr quin walking away from him down a country lane lovers lane they had called it he had always expected to see mr quin again once a year at least possibly twice a year but no that had not happened and so today he had had the wonderful and surprising idea that here in the village of kingsbourne ducis he might once again find mr harley quin absurd of me said mr satterthwaite quite absurd of me really the ideas one has as one gets old he had missed mr quin missed something that had been one of the most exciting things in the late years of his life someone who might turn up anywhere and who if he did turn up was always an announcement that something was going to happen something that was going to happen to him no that was not quite right not to him but through him that was the exciting part just from the words that mr quin might utter words things he might show him ideas would come to mr satterthwaite he would see things he would imagine things he would find out things he would deal with something that needed to be dealt with and opposite him would sit mr quin perhaps smiling approval something that mr quin said would start the flow of ideas the active person would be he himself he mr satterthwaite the man with so many old friends a man among whose friends had been duchesses an occasional bishop people that counted especially he had to admit people who had counted in the social world because after all mr satterthwaite had always been a snob he had liked duchesses he had liked knowing old families families who had represented the landed gentry of england for several generations and he had had too an interest in young people not necessarily socially important young people who were in trouble who were in love who were unhappy who needed help because of mr quin mr satterthwaite was enabled to give help and now like an idiot he was looking into an unprepossessing village cafe and a shop for modern china and tea sets and casseroles no doubt all the same said mr satterthwaite to himself i must go in now ive been foolish enough to walk back here i must go in just well just in case theyll be longer i expect doing the car than they say it will be more than ten minutes just in case there was anything interesting inside he looked once more at the window full of china he appreciated suddenly that it was good china well made a good modern product he looked back into the past remembering the duchess of leith he remembered what a wonderful old lady she had been how kind she had been to her maid on the occasion of a very rough sea voyage to the island of corsica she had ministered to her with the kindliness of a ministering angel and only on the next day had she resumed her autocratic bullying manner which the domestics of those days had seemed able to stand quite easily without any sign of rebellion maria yes thats what the duchesss name had been dear old maria leith ah well she had died some years ago but she had had a harlequin breakfast set he remembered yes big round cups in different colours black yellow red and a particularly pernicious shade of puce puce he thought must have been a favourite colour of hers she had had a rockingham tea set he remembered in which the predominating colour had been puce decorated with gold ah sighed mr satterthwaite those were the days well i suppose id better go in perhaps order a cup of coffee or something it will be very full of milk i expect and possibly already sweetened but still one has to pass the time he went in the cafe side was practically empty it was early mr satterthwaite supposed for people to want cups of tea and anyway very few people did want cups of tea nowadays except that is occasionally elderly people in their own homes there was a young couple in the far window and two women gossiping at a table against the back wall i said to her one of them was saying i said you cant do that sort of thing no its not the sort of thing that ill put up with and i said the same to henry and he agreed with me it shot through mr satterthwaites mind that henry must have rather a hard life and that no doubt he had found it always wise to agree whatever the proposition put up to him might be a most unattractive woman with a most unattractive friend he turned his attention to the other side of the building murmuring may i just look round there was quite a pleasant woman in charge and she said oh yes sir weve got a good stock at present mr satterthwaite looked at the coloured cups picked up one or two of them examined the milk jug picked up a china zebra and considered it examined some ashtrays of a fairly pleasing pattern he heard chairs being pushed back and turning his head noted that the two middle aged women still discussing former grievances had paid their bill and were now leaving the shop as they went out of the door a tall man in a dark suit came in he sat down at the table which they had just vacated his back was to mr satterthwaite who thought that he had an attractive back lean strong well muscled but rather dark and sinister looking because there was very little light in the shop mr satterthwaite looked back again at the ashtrays i might buy an ashtray so as not to cause a disappointment to the shop owner he thought as he did so the sun came out suddenly he had not realized that the shop had looked dim because of the lack of sunshine the sun must have been under a cloud for some time it had clouded over he remembered at about the time they had got to the service station but now there was this sudden burst of sunlight it caught up the colours of the china and through a coloured glass window of somewhat ecclesiastical pattern which must mr satterthwaite thought have been left over in the original victorian house the sun came through the window and lit up the dingy cafe in some curious way it lit up the back of the man who had just sat down there instead of a dark black silhouette there was now a festoon of colours red and blue and yellow and suddenly mr satterthwaite realized that he was looking at exactly what he had hoped to find his intuition had not played him false he knew who it was who had just come in and sat down there he knew so well that he had no need to wait until he could look at the face he turned his back on the china went back into the cafe round the corner of the round table and sat down opposite the man who had just come in mr quin said mr satterthwaite i knew somehow it was going to be you mr quin smiled you always know so many things he said its a long time since ive seen you said mr satterthwaite does time matter said mr quin perhaps not you may be right perhaps not may i offer you some refreshment is there any refreshment to be had said mr satterthwaite doubtfully i suppose you must have come in for that purpose one is never quite sure of ones purpose is one said mr quin i am so pleased to see you again said mr satterthwaite id almost forgotten you know i mean forgotten the way you talk the things you say the things you make me think of the things you make me do i make you do you are so wrong you have always known yourself just what you wanted to do and why you want to do them and why you know so well that they have to be done i only feel that when you are here oh no said mr quin lightly i have nothing to do with it i am just as ive often told you i am just passing by that is all today you are passing by through kingsbourne ducis and you are not passing by you are going to a definite place am i right im going to see a very old friend a friend i have not seen for a good many years hes old now somewhat crippled he has had one stroke he has recovered from it quite well but one never knows does he live by himself not now i am glad to say his family have come back from abroad what is left of his family that is they have been living with him now for some months i am glad to be able to come and see them again all together those thats to say that i have seen before and those that i have not seen you mean children children and grandchildren mr satterthwaite sighed just for a moment he was sad that he had had no children and no grandchildren and no great grandchildren himself he did not usually regret it at all they have some special turkish coffee here said mr quin really good of its kind everything else is as you have guessed rather unpalatable but one can always have a cup of turkish coffee can one not let us have one because i suppose you will soon have to get on with your pilgrimage or whatever it is in the doorway came a small black dog he came and sat down by the table and looked up at mr quin your dog said mr satterthwaite yes let me introduce you to hermes he stroked the black dogs head coffee he said tell ali the black dog walked from the table through a door at the back of the shop they heard him give a short incisive bark presently he reappeared and with him came a young man with a very dark complexion wearing an emerald green pullover coffee ali said mr quin two coffees turkish coffee thats right isnt it sir he smiled and disappeared the dog sat down again tell me said mr satterthwaite tell me where youve been and what you have been doing and why i have not seen you for so long i have just told you that time really means nothing it is clear in my mind and i think it is clear in yours the occasion when we last met a very tragic occasion said mr satterthwaite i do not really like to think of it because of death but death is not always a tragedy i have told you that before no said mr satterthwaite perhaps that death the one we are both thinking of was not a tragedy but all the same    but all the same it is life that really matters you are quite right of course said mr quin quite right it is life that matters we do not want someone young someone who is happy or could be happy to die neither of us want that do we that is the reason why we must always save a life when the command comes have you got a command for me me command for you harley quins long sad face brightened into its peculiarly charming smile i have no commands for you mr satterthwaite i have never had commands you yourself know things see things know what to do do them it has nothing to do with me oh yes it has said mr satterthwaite youre not going to change my mind on that point but tell me where have you been during what it is too short to call time well i have been here and there in different countries different climates different adventures but mostly as usual just passing by i think it is more for you to tell me not only what you have been doing but what you are going to do now more about where you are going who you are going to meet your friends what they are like of course i will tell you i should enjoy telling you because i have been wondering thinking you know about these friends i am going to when you have not seen a family for a long time when you have not been closely connected with them for many years it is always a nervous moment when you are going to resume old friendships and old ties you are so right said mr quin the turkish coffee was brought in little cups of oriental pattern ali placed them with a smile and departed mr satterthwaite sipped approvingly as sweet as love as black as night and as hot as hell that is the old arab phrase isnt it harley smiled over his shoulder and nodded yes said mr satterthwaite i must tell you where i am going through what i am doing hardly matters i am going to renew old friendships to make acquaintance with the younger generation tom addison as i have said is a very old friend of mine we did many things together in our young days then as often happens life parted us he was in the diplomatic service went abroad for several foreign posts in turn sometimes i went and stayed with him sometimes i saw him when he was home in england one of his early posts was in spain he married a spanish girl a very beautiful dark girl called pilar he loved her very much they had children two daughters a fair haired baby like her father called lily and a second daughter maria who took after her spanish mother i was lilys godfather naturally i did not see either of the children very often two or three times a year either i gave a party for lily or went to see her at her school she was a sweet and lovely person very devoted to her father and he was very devoted to her but in between these meetings these revivals of friendship we went through some difficult times you will know about it as well as i do i and my contemporaries had difficulties in meeting through the war years lily married a pilot in the air force a fighter pilot until the other day i had even forgotten his name simon gilliatt squadron leader gilliatt he was killed in the war no no no he came through safely after the war he resigned from the air force and he and lily went out to kenya as so many did they settled there and they lived very happily they had a son a little boy called roland later when he was at school in england i saw him once or twice the last time i think was when he was twelve years old a nice boy he had red hair like his father ive not seen him since so i am looking forward to seeing him today he is twenty three twenty four now time goes on so is he married no well not yet ah prospects of marriage well i wondered from something tom addison said in his letter there is a girl cousin the younger daughter maria married the local doctor i never knew her very well it was rather sad she died in childbirth her little girl was called inez a family name chosen by her spanish grandmother as it happens i have only seen inez once since she grew up a dark spanish type very much like her grandmother but i am boring you with all this no i want to hear it it is very interesting to me i wonder why said mr satterthwaite he looked at mr quin with that slight air of suspicion which sometimes came to him you want to know all about this family why so that i can picture it perhaps in my mind well this house i am going to doverton kingsbourne it is called it is quite a beautiful old house not so spectacular as to invite tourists or to be open to visitors on special days just a quiet country house to live in by an englishman who has served his country and comes back to enjoy a mellow life when the age of retirement comes tom was always fond of country life he enjoyed fishing he was a good shot and we had very happy days together in his family home of his boyhood i spent many of my own holidays as a boy at doverton kingsbourne and all through my life i have had that image in my mind no place like doverton kingsbourne no other house to touch it every time i drove near it i would make a detour perhaps and just pass to see the view through a gap in the trees of the long lane that runs in front of the house glimpses of the river where we used to fish and of the house itself and i would remember all the things that tom and i did together he has been a man of action a man who has done things and i i have just been an old bachelor you have been more than that said mr quin you have been a man who made friends who had many friends and who has served his friends well well if i can think that perhaps you are being too kind not at all you are very good company besides the stories you can tell the things youve seen the places you have visited the curious things that have happened in your life you could write a whole book on them said mr quin i should make you the main character in it if i did no you would not said mr quin i am the one who passes by that is all but go on tell me more well this is just a family chronicle that im telling you as i say there were long periods years of time when i did not see any of them but they have been always my old friends i saw tom and pilar until the time when pilar died she died rather young unfortunately lily my godchild inez the quiet doctors daughter who lives in the village with her father    how old is the daughter inez is nineteen or twenty i think i shall be glad to make friends with her so it is on the whole a happy chronicle not entirely lily my godchild the one who went to kenya with her husband was killed there in an automobile accident she was killed outright leaving behind her a baby of barely a year old little roland simon her husband was quite brokenhearted they were an unusually happy couple however the best thing happened to him that could happen i suppose he married again a young widow who was the widow of a squadron leader a friend of his and who also had been left with a baby the same age little timothy and little roland had only two or three months in age between them simons marriage i believe has been quite happy though ive not seen them of course because they continued to live in kenya the boys were brought up like brothers they went to the same school in england and spent their holidays usually in kenya i have not seen them of course for many years well you know what has happened in kenya some people have managed to stay on some people friends of mine have gone to western australia and have settled again happily there with their families some have come home to this country simon gilliatt and his wife and their two children left kenya it was not the same to them and so they came home and accepted the invitation that has always been given them and renewed every year by old tom addison they have come his son in law his son in laws second wife and the two children now grown up boys or rather young men they have come to live as a family there and they are happy toms other grandchild inez horton as i told you lives in the village with her father the doctor and she spends a good deal of her time i gather at doverton kingsbourne with tom addison who is very devoted to his granddaughter they sound all very happy together there he has urged me several times to come there and see meet them all again and so i accepted the invitation just for a weekend it will be sad in some ways to see dear old tom again somewhat crippled with perhaps not a very long expectation of life but still cheerful and gay as far as i can make out and to see also the old house again doverton kingsbourne tied up with all my boyish memories when one has not lived a very eventful life when nothing has happened to one personally and that is true of me the things that remain with you are the friends the houses and the things you did as a child and a boy and a young man there is only one thing that worries me you should not be worried what is it that worries you that i might be disappointed the house one remembers one has dreams of when one might come to see it again it would not be as you remembered it or dreamt it a new wing would have been added the garden would have been altered all sorts of things can have happened to it it is a very long time really since i have been there i think your memories will go with you said mr quin i am glad you are going there i have an idea said mr satterthwaite come with me come with me on this visit you need not fear that youll not be welcome dear tom addison is the most hospitable fellow in the world any friend of mine would immediately be a friend of his come with me you must i insist making an impulsive gesture mr satterthwaite nearly knocked his coffee cup off the table he caught it just in time at that moment the shop door was pushed open ringing its old fashioned bell as it did so a middle aged woman came in she was slightly out of breath and looked somewhat hot she was good looking still with a head of auburn hair only just touched here and there with grey she had that clear ivory coloured skin that so often goes with reddish hair and blue eyes and she had kept her figure well the newcomer swept a quick glance round the cafe and turned immediately into the china shop oh she exclaimed youve still got some of the harlequin cups yes mrs gilliatt we had a new stock arrived in yesterday oh im so pleased i really have been very worried i rushed down here i took one of the boys motorbikes theyd gone off somewhere and i couldnt find either of them but i really had to do something there was an unfortunate accident this morning with some of the cups and weve got people arriving for tea and a party this afternoon so if you can give me a blue and a green and perhaps id better have another red one as well in case thats the worst of these different coloured cups isnt it well i know they do say as its a disadvantage and you cant always replace the particular colour you want mr satterthwaites head had gone over his shoulder now and he was looking with some interest at what was going on mrs gilliatt the shop woman had said but of course he realized it now this must be he rose from his seat half hesitating and then took a step or two into the shop excuse me he said but are you are you mrs gilliatt from doverton kingsbourne oh yes i am beryl gilliatt do you i mean     she looked at him wrinkling her brows a little an attractive woman mr satterthwaite thought rather a hard face perhaps but competent so this was simon gilliatts second wife she hadnt got the beauty of lily but she seemed an attractive woman pleasant and efficient suddenly a smile came to mrs gilliatts face i do believe    yes of course my father in law tom has got a photograph of you and you must be the guest we are expecting this afternoon you must be mr satterthwaite exactly said mr satterthwaite that is who i am but i shall have to apologize very much for being so much later in arriving than i said but unfortunately my car has had a breakdown its in the garage now being attended to oh how miserable for you but what a shame but its not tea time yet dont worry weve put it off anyway as you probably heard i ran down to replace a few cups which unfortunately got swept off a table this morning whenever one has anyone to lunch or tea or dinner something like that always happens there you are mrs gilliatt said the woman in the shop ill wrap them up in here shall i put them in a box for you no if youll just put some paper around them and put them in this shopping bag of mine theyll be quite all right that way if you are returning to doverton kingsbourne said mr satterthwaite i could give you a lift in my car it will be arriving from the garage any moment now thats very kind of you i wish really i could accept but ive simply got to take the motorbike back the boys will be miserable without it theyre going somewhere this evening let me introduce you said mr satterthwaite he turned towards mr quin who had risen to his feet and was now standing quite near this is an old friend of mine mr harley quin whom i have just happened to run across here ive been trying to persuade him to come along to doverton kingsbourne would it be possible do you think for tom to put up yet another guest for tonight oh im sure it would be quite all right said beryl gilliatt im sure hed be delighted to see another friend of yours perhaps its a friend of his as well no said mr quin ive never met mr addison though ive often heard my friend mr satterthwaite speak of him well then do let mr satterthwaite bring you we should be delighted i am very sorry said mr quin unfortunately i have another engagement indeed  he looked at his watch  i must start for it immediately i am late already which is what comes of meeting old friends here you are mrs gilliatt said the saleswoman itll be quite all right i think in your bag beryl gilliatt put the parcel carefully into the bag she was carrying then said to mr satterthwaite well see you presently tea isnt until quarter past five so dont worry im so pleased to meet you at last having heard so much about you always both from simon and from my father in law she said a hurried goodbye to mr quin and went out of the shop bit of a hurry shes in isnt she said the shop woman but shes always like that gets through a lot in a day id say the sound of the bicycle outside was heard as it revved up quite a character isnt she said mr satterthwaite it would seem so said mr quin and i really cant persuade you im only passing by said mr quin and when shall i see you again i wonder now oh it will not be very long said mr quin i think you will recognize me when you do see me have you nothing more nothing more to tell me nothing more to explain to explain what to explain why i have met you here you are a man of considerable knowledge said mr quin one word might mean something to you i think it would and it might come in useful what word daltonism said mr quin he smiled i dont think  mr satterthwaite frowned for a moment yes yes i do know only just for the moment i cant remember    goodbye for the present said mr quin here is your car at that moment the car was indeed pulling up by the post office door mr satterthwaite went out to it he was anxious not to waste more time and keep his hosts waiting longer than need be but he was sad all the same at saying goodbye to his friend there is nothing i can do for you he said and his tone was almost wistful nothing you can do for me for someone else i think so very likely i hope i know what you mean i have the utmost faith in you said mr quin you always know things you are very quick to observe and to know the meaning of things you have not changed i assure you his hand rested for a moment on mr satterthwaites shoulder then he walked out and proceeded briskly down the village street in the opposite direction to doverton kingsbourne mr satterthwaite got into his car i hope we shant have any more trouble he said his chauffeur reassured him its no distance from here sir three or four miles at most and shes running beautifully now he ran the car a little way along the street and turned where the road widened so as to return the way he had just come he said again only three or four miles mr satterthwaite said again daltonism it still didnt mean anything to him but yet he felt it should it was a word hed heard used before doverton kingsbourne said mr satterthwaite to himself he said it very softly under his breath the two words still meant to him what they had always meant a place of joyous reunion a place where he couldnt get there too quickly a place where he was going to enjoy himself even though so many of those whom he had known would not be there any longer but tom would be there his old friend tom and he thought again of the grass and the lake and the river and the things they had done together as boys tea was set out upon the lawn steps led out from the french windows in the drawing room and down to where a big copper beech at one side and a cedar of lebanon on the other made the setting for the afternoon scene there were two painted and carved white tables and various garden chairs upright ones with coloured cushions and lounging ones where you could lean back and stretch your feet out and sleep if you wished to do so some of them had hoods over them to guard you from the sun it was a beautiful early evening and the green of the grass was a soft deep colour the golden light came through the copper beech and the cedar showed the lines of its beauty against a soft pinkish golden sky tom addison was waiting for his guest in a long basket chair his feet up mr satterthwaite noted with some amusement what he remembered from many other occasions of meeting his host he had comfortable bedroom slippers suited to his slightly swollen gouty feet and the shoes were odd ones one red and one green good old tom thought mr satterthwaite he hasnt changed just the same and he thought what an idiot i am of course i know what that word meant why didnt i think of it at once thought you were never going to turn up you old devil said tom addison he was still a handsome old man a broad face with deep set twinkling grey eyes shoulders that were still square and gave him a look of power every line in his face seemed a line of good humour and of affectionate welcome he never changes thought mr satterthwaite cant get up to greet you said tom addison takes two strong men and a stick to get me on my feet now do you know our little crowd or dont you you know simon of course of course i do its a good few years since ive seen you but you havent changed much squadron leader simon gilliatt was a lean handsome man with a mop of red hair sorry you never came to see us when we were in kenya he said youd have enjoyed yourself lots of things we could have shown you ah well one cant see what the future may bring i thought id lay my bones in that country weve got a very nice churchyard here said tom addison nobodys ruined our church yet by restoring it and we havent very much new building round about so theres plenty of room in the churchyard still we havent had one of these terrible additions of a new intake of graves what a gloomy conversation youre having said beryl gilliatt smiling these are our boys she said but you know them already dont you mr satterthwaite i dont think id have known them now said mr satterthwaite indeed the last time he had seen the two boys was on a day when he had taken them out from their prep school although there was no relationship between them they had had different fathers and mothers yet the boys could have been and often were taken for brothers they were about the same height and they both had red hair roland presumably having inherited it from his father and timothy from his auburn haired mother there seemed also to be a kind of comradeship between them yet really mr satterthwaite thought they were very different the difference was clearer now when they were he supposed between twenty two and twenty five years old he could see no resemblance in roland to his grandfather nor apart from his red hair did he look like his father mr satterthwaite had wondered sometimes whether the boy would look like lily his dead mother but there again he could see little resemblance if anything timothy looked more as a son of lilys might have looked the fair skin and the high forehead and a delicacy of bone structure at his elbow a soft deep voice said im inez i dont expect you remember me it was quite a long time ago when i saw you a beautiful girl mr satterthwaite thought at once a dark type he cast his mind back a long way to the days when he had come to be best man at tom addisons wedding to pilar she showed her spanish blood he thought the carriage of her head and the dark aristocratic beauty her father dr horton was standing just behind her he looked much older than when mr satterthwaite had seen him last a nice man and kindly a good general practitioner unambitious but reliable and devoted mr satterthwaite thought to his daughter he was obviously immensely proud of her mr satterthwaite felt an enormous happiness creeping over him all these people he thought although some of them strange to him it seemed like friends he had already known the dark beautiful girl the two red haired boys beryl gilliatt fussing over the tea tray arranging cups and saucers beckoning to a maid from the house to bring out cakes and plates of sandwiches a splendid tea there were chairs that pulled up to the tables so that you could sit comfortably eating all you wanted to eat the boys settled themselves inviting mr satterthwaite to sit between them he was pleased at that he had already planned in his own mind that it was the boys he wanted to talk to first to see how much they recalled to him tom addison in the old days and he thought lily how i wish lily could be here now here he was thought mr satterthwaite here he was back in his boyhood here where he had come and been welcomed by toms father and mother an aunt or so too there had been and a great uncle and cousins and now well there were not so many in this family but it was a family tom in his bedroom slippers one red one green old but still merry and happy happy in those who were spread round him and here was doverton just or almost just as it had been not quite so well kept up perhaps but the lawn was in good condition and down there he could see the gleam of the river through the trees and the trees too more trees than there had been and the house needing perhaps another coat of paint but not too badly after all tom addison was a rich man well provided for owning a large quantity of land a man with simple tastes who spent enough to keep his place up but was not a spendthrift in other ways he seldom travelled or went abroad nowadays but he entertained not big parties just friends friends who came to stay friends who usually had some connection going back into the past a friendly house he turned a little in his chair drawing it away from the table and turning it sideways so that he could see better the view down to the river down there was the mill of course and beyond the other side there were fields and in one of the fields it amused him to see a kind of scarecrow a dark figure on which birds were settling on the straw just for a moment he thought it looked like mr harley quin perhaps thought mr satterthwaite it is my friend mr quin it was an absurd idea and yet if someone had piled up the scarecrow and tried to make it look like mr quin it could have had the sort of slender elegance that was foreign to most scarecrows one saw are you looking at our scarecrow said timothy weve got a name for him you know we call him mister harley barley do you indeed said mr satterthwaite dear me i find that very interesting why do you find it interesting said roly with some curiosity well because it rather resembles someone that i know whose name happens to be harley his first name that is the boys began singing harley barley stands on guard harley barley takes things hard guards the ricks and guards the hay keeps the trespassers away cucumber sandwich mr satterthwaite said beryl gilliatt or do you prefer a homemade pt one mr satterthwaite accepted the homemade pt she deposited by his side a puce cup the same colour as he had admired in the shop how gay it looked all that tea set on the table yellow red blue green and all the rest of it he wondered if each one had their favourite colour timothy he noticed had a red cup roland had a yellow one beside timothys cup was an object mr satterthwaite could not at first identify then he saw it was a meerschaum pipe it was years since mr satterthwaite had thought of or seen a meerschaum pipe roland noticing what he was looking at said tim brought that back from germany when he went hes killing himself with cancer smoking his pipe all the time dont you smoke roland no im not one for smoking i dont smoke cigarettes and i dont smoke pot either inez came to the table and sat down the other side of him both the young men pressed food upon her they started a laughing conversation together mr satterthwaite felt very happy among these young people not that they took very much notice of him apart from their natural politeness but he liked hearing them he liked too making up his judgement about them he thought he was almost sure that both the young men were in love with inez well it was not surprising propinquity brings these things about they had come to live here with their grandfather a beautiful girl rolands first cousin was living almost next door mr satterthwaite turned his head he could just see the house through the trees where it poked up from the road just beyond the front gate that was the same house that dr horton had lived in last time he came here seven or eight years ago he looked at inez he wondered which of the two young men she preferred or whether her affections were already engaged elsewhere there was no reason why she should fall in love with one of these two attractive young specimens of the male race having eaten as much as he wanted it was not very much mr satterthwaite drew his chair back altering its angle a little so that he could look all round him mrs gilliatt was still busy very much the housewife he thought making perhaps rather more of a fuss than she need of domesticity continually offering people cakes taking their cups away and replenishing them handing things round somehow he thought it would be more pleasant and more informal if she let people help themselves he wished she was not so busy a hostess he looked up to the place where tom addison lay stretched out in his chair tom addison was also watching beryl gilliatt mr satterthwaite thought to himself he doesnt like her no tom doesnt like her well perhaps thats to be expected after all beryl had taken the place of his own daughter of simon gilliatts first wife lily my beautiful lily thought mr satterthwaite again and wondered why for some reason he felt that although he could not see anyone like her yet lily in some strange way was here she was here at this tea party i suppose one begins to imagine these things as one gets old said mr satterthwaite after all why shouldnt lily be here to see her son he looked affectionately at timothy and then suddenly realized that he was not looking at lilys son roland was lilys son timothy was beryls son i believe lily knows im here i believe shed like to speak to me said mr satterthwaite oh dear oh dear i mustnt start imagining foolish things for some reason he looked again at the scarecrow it didnt look like a scarecrow now it looked like mr harley quin some tricks of the light of the sunset were providing it with colour and there was a black dog like hermes chasing the birds colour said mr satterthwaite and looked again at the table and the tea set and the people having tea why am i here said mr satterthwaite to himself why am i here and what ought i to be doing theres a reason    now he knew he felt there was something some crisis something affecting affecting all these people or only some of them beryl gilliatt mrs gilliatt she was nervous about something on edge tom nothing wrong with tom he wasnt affected a lucky man to own this beauty to own doverton and to have a grandson so that when he died all this would come to roland all this would be rolands was tom hoping that roland would marry inez or would he have a fear of first cousins marrying though throughout history mr satterthwaite thought brothers had married sisters with no ill result nothing must happen said mr satterthwaite nothing must happen i must prevent it really his thoughts were the thoughts of a madman a peaceful scene a tea set the varying colours of the harlequin cups he looked at the white meerschaum pipe lying against the red of the cup beryl gilliatt said something to timothy timothy nodded got up and went off towards the house beryl removed some empty plates from the table adjusted a chair or two murmured something to roland who went across and offered a frosted cake to dr horton mr satterthwaite watched her he had to watch her the sweep of her sleeve as she passed the table he saw a red cup get pushed off the table it broke on the iron feet of a chair he heard her little exclamation as she picked up the bits she went to the tea tray came back and placed on the table a pale blue cup and saucer she replaced the meerschaum pipe putting it close against it she brought the teapot and poured tea then she moved away the table was untenanted now inez also had got up and left it gone to speak to her grandfather i dont understand said mr satterthwaite to himself somethings going to happen whats going to happen a table with different coloured cups round and yes timothy his red hair glowing in the sun red hair glowing with that same tint that attractive sideways wave that simon gilliatts hair had always had timothy coming back standing a moment looking at the table with a slightly puzzled eye then going to where the meerschaum pipe rested against the pale blue cup inez came back then she laughed suddenly and she said timothy youre drinking your tea out of the wrong cup the blue cups mine yours is the red one and timothy said dont be silly inez i know my own cup its got sugar in it and you wont like it nonsense this is my cup the meerschaums up against it it came to mr satterthwaite then a shock was he mad was he imagining things was any of this real he got up he walked quickly towards the table and as timothy raised the blue cup to his lips he shouted dont drink that he called dont drink it i say timothy turned a surprised face mr satterthwaite turned his head dr horton rather startled got up from his seat and was coming near whats the matter satterthwaite that cup theres something wrong about it said mr satterthwaite dont let the boy drink from it horton stared at it my dear fellow  i know what im saying the red cup was his said mr satterthwaite and the red cups broken its been replaced with a blue one he doesnt know the red from blue does he dr horton looked puzzled dyou mean dyou mean like tom tom addison hes colour blind you know that dont you oh yes of course we all know that thats why hes got odd shoes on today he never knew red from green this boy is the same but but surely not anyway theres never been any sign of it in in roland there might be though mightnt there said mr satterthwaite im right in thinking daltonism thats what they call it dont they it was a name they used to call it by yes its not inherited by a female but it passes through the female lily wasnt colour blind but lilys son might easily be colour blind but my dear satterthwaite timothy isnt lilys son roly is lilys son i know theyre rather alike same age same coloured hair and things but well perhaps you dont remember no said mr satterthwaite i shouldnt have remembered but i know now i can see the resemblance too rolands beryls son they were both babies werent they when simon remarried it is very easy for a woman looking after two babies especially if both of them were going to have red hair timothys lilys son and roland is beryls son beryls and christopher edens there is no reason why he should be colour blind i know it i tell you i know it he saw dr hortons eyes go from one to the other timothy not catching what they said but standing holding the blue cup and looking puzzled i saw her buy it said mr satterthwaite listen to me man you must listen to me youve known me for some years you know that i dont make mistakes if i say a thing positively quite true ive never known you make a mistake take that cup away from him said mr satterthwaite take it back to your surgery or take it to an analytic chemist and find out whats in it i saw that woman buy that cup she bought it in the village shop she knew then that she was going to break a red cup replace it by a blue and that timothy would never know that the colours were different i think youre mad satterthwaite but all the same im going to do what you say he advanced on the table stretched out a hand to the blue cup do you mind letting me have a look at that said dr horton of course said timothy he looked slightly surprised i think theres a flaw in the china here you know rather interesting beryl came across the lawn she came quickly and sharply what are you doing whats the matter what is happening nothings the matter said dr horton cheerfully i just want to show the boys a little experiment im going to make with a cup of tea he was looking at her very closely and he saw the expression of fear of terror mr satterthwaite saw the entire change of countenance would you like to come with me satterthwaite just a little experiment you know a matter of testing porcelain and different qualities in it nowadays a very interesting discovery was made lately chatting he walked along the grass mr satterthwaite followed him and the two young men chatting to each other followed him whats the doc up to now roly said timothy i dont know said roland he seems to have got some very extraordinary ideas oh well we shall hear about it later i expect lets go and get our bikes beryl gilliatt turned abruptly she retraced her steps rapidly up the lawn towards the house tom addison called to her anything the matter beryl something id forgotten said beryl gilliatt thats all tom addison looked inquiringly towards simon gilliatt anything wrong with your wife he said beryl oh no not that i know of i expect its some little thing or other that shes forgotten nothing i can do for you beryl he called no no ill be back later she turned her head half sideways looking at the old man lying back in the chair she spoke suddenly and vehemently you silly old fool youve got the wrong shoes on again today they dont match do you know youve got one shoe thats red and one shoe thats green ah done it again have i said tom addison they look exactly the same colour to me you know its odd isnt it but there it is she went past him her steps quickening presently mr satterthwaite and dr horton reached the gate that led out into the roadway they heard a motor bicycle speeding along shes gone said dr horton shes run for it we ought to have stopped her i suppose do you think shell come back no said mr satterthwaite i dont think shell come back perhaps he said thoughtfully its best left that way you mean its an old house said mr satterthwaite and old family a good family a lot of good people in it one doesnt want trouble scandal everything brought upon it best to let her go i think tom addison never liked her said dr horton never he was always polite and kind but he didnt like her and theres the boy to think of said mr satterthwaite the boy you mean the other boy roland this way he neednt know about what his mother was trying to do why did she do it why on earth did she do it youve no doubt now that she did said mr satterthwaite no ive no doubt now i saw her face satterthwaite when she looked at me i knew then that what youd said was truth but why greed i suppose said mr satterthwaite she hadnt any money of her own i believe her husband christopher eden was a nice chap by all accounts but he hadnt anything in the way of means but tom addisons grandchild has got big money coming to him a lot of money property all around here has appreciated enormously ive no doubt that tom addison will leave the bulk of what he has to his grandson she wanted it for her own son and through her own son of course for herself she is a greedy woman mr satterthwaite turned his head back suddenly somethings on fire over there he said good lord so it is oh its the scarecrow down in the field some young chap or others set fire to it i suppose but theres nothing to worry about there are no ricks or anything anywhere near itll just burn itself out yes said mr satterthwaite well you go on doctor you dont need me to help you in your tests ive no doubt of what i shall find i dont mean the exact substance but i have come to your belief that this blue cup holds death mr satterthwaite had turned back through the gate he was going now down in the direction where the scarecrow was burning behind it was the sunset a remarkable sunset that evening its colours illuminated the air round it illuminated the burning scarecrow so thats the way youve chosen to go said mr satterthwaite he looked slightly startled then for in the neighbourhood of the flames he saw the tall slight figure of a woman a woman dressed in some pale mother of pearl colouring she was walking in the direction of mr satterthwaite he stopped dead watching lily he said lily he saw her quite plainly now it was lily walking towards him too far away for him to see her face but he knew very well who it was just for a moment or two he wondered whether anyone else would see her or whether the sight was only for him he said not very loud only in a whisper its all right lily your son is safe she stopped then she raised one hand to her lips he didnt see her smile but he knew she was smiling she kissed her hand and waved it to him and then she turned she walked back towards where the scarecrow was disintegrating into a mass of ashes shes going away again said mr satterthwaite to himself shes going away with him theyre walking away together they belong to the same world of course they only come those sort of people they only come when its a case of love or death or both he wouldnt see lily again he supposed but he wondered how soon he would meet mr quin again he turned then and went back across the lawn towards the tea table and the harlequin tea set and beyond that to his old friend tom addison beryl wouldnt come back he was sure of it doverton kingsbourne was safe again across the lawn came the small black dog in flying leaps it came to mr satterthwaite panting a little and wagging its tail through its collar was twisted a scrap of paper mr satterthwaite stooped and detached it smoothing it out on it in coloured letters was written a message congratulations to our next meeting hq thank you hermes said mr satterthwaite and watched the black dog flying across the meadow to rejoin the two figures that he himself knew were there but could no longer see ,1971,1182,13525,10929,92.75480814676924,9.246192893401016,1.2375331686339097, mr satterthwaite clucked twice in vexation whether right in his assumption or not he was more and more convinced that cars nowadays broke down far more frequently than they used to do the only cars he trusted were old friends who had survived the test of time they had their little idiosyncrasies but you knew about those provided for them fulfilled their wants before the demand became too acute but new cars full of new gadgets different kinds of windows an instrument panel newly and differently arranged handsome in its glistening wood but being unfamiliar your groping hand hovered uneasily over fog lights windscreen wipers the choke et cetera all these things with knobs in a place you didnt expect them and when your gleaming new purchase failed in performance your local garage uttered the intensely irritating words teething troubles splendid car sir these roadsters super superbos all the latest accessories but bound to have their teething troubles you know ha ha just as though a car was a baby but mr satterthwaite being now of an advanced age was strongly of the opinion that a new car ought to be fully adult tested inspected and its teething troubles already dealt with before it came into its purchasers possession mr satterthwaite was on his way to pay a weekend visit to friends in the country his new car had already on the way from london given certain symptoms of discomfort and was now drawn up in a garage waiting for the diagnosis and how long it would take before he could resume progress towards his destination his chauffeur was in consultation with a mechanic mr satterthwaite sat striving for patience he had assured his hosts on the telephone the night before that he would be arriving in good time for tea he would reach doverton kingsbourne he assured them well before four oclock he clucked again in irritation and tried to turn his thoughts to something pleasant it was no good sitting here in a state of acute irritation frequently consulting his wristwatch clucking once more and giving he had to realize a very good imitation of a hen pleased with its prowess in laying an egg yes something pleasant yes now hadnt there been something something he had noticed as they were driving along not very long ago something that he had seen through the window which had pleased and excited him but before he had had time to think about it the cars misbehavior had become more pronounced and a rapid visit to the nearest service station had been inevitable what was it that he had seen on the left no on the right yes on the right as they drove slowly through the village street next door to a post office yes he was quite sure of that next door to a post office because the sight of the post office had given him the idea of telephoning to the addisons to break the news that he might be slightly late in his arrival the post office a village post office and next to it yes definitely next to it next door or if not next door the door after something that had stirred old memories and he had wanted just what was it that he had wanted oh dear it would come to him presently it was mixed up with a colour several colours yes a colour or colours or a word some definite word that had stirred memories thoughts pleasures gone by excitement recalling something that had been vivid and alive something in which he himself had not only seen but observed no he had done more he had taken part taken part in what and why and where all sorts of places the answer came quickly at the last thought all sorts of places on an island in corsica at monte carlo watching the croupier spinning his roulette wheel a house in the country all sorts of places and he had been there and someone else yes someone else it all tied up with that he was getting there at last if he could just    he was interrupted at that moment by the chauffeur coming to the window with the garage mechanic in tow behind him wont be long now sir the chauffeur assured mr satterthwaite cheerfully matter of ten minutes or so not more nothing seriously wrong said the mechanic in a low hoarse country voice teething troubles as you might say mr satterthwaite did not cluck this time he gnashed his own teeth a phrase he had often read in books and which in old age he seemed to have got into the habit of doing himself due perhaps to the slight looseness of his upper plate really teething trouble toothache teeth gnashing false teeth ones whole life centred he thought about teeth doverton kingsbournes only a few miles away said the chauffeur and theyve a taxi here you could go on in that sir and id bring the car along later as soon as its fixed up no said mr satterthwaite he said the word explosively and both the chauffeur and the mechanic looked startled mr satterthwaites eyes were sparkling his voice was clear and decisive memory had come to him i propose he said to walk along the road we have just come by when the car is ready you will pick me up there the harlequin cafe i think it is called its not very much of a place sir the mechanic advised that is where i shall be said mr satterthwaite speaking with a kind of regal autocracy he walked off briskly the two men stared after him dont know whats got into him said the chauffeur never seen him like that before the village of kingsbourne ducis did not live up to the old world grandeur of its name it was a smallish village consisting of one street a few houses shops that were dotted rather unevenly sometimes betraying the fact that they were houses which had been turned into shops or that they were shops which now existed as houses without any industrial intentions it was not particularly old world or beautiful it was just simple and rather unobtrusive perhaps that was why thought mr satterthwaite that a dash of brilliant colour had caught his eye ah here he was at the post office the post office was a simply functioning post office with a pillar box outside a display of some newspapers and some postcards and surely next to it yes there was the sign up above the harlequin cafe a sudden qualm struck mr satterthwaite really he was getting too old he had fancies why should that one word stir his heart the harlequin cafe the mechanic at the service station had been quite right it did not look like a place in which one would really be tempted to have a meal a snack perhaps a morning coffee then why but he suddenly realized why because the cafe or perhaps one could better put it as the house that sheltered the cafe was in two portions one side of it had small tables with chairs round them arranged ready for patrons who came here to eat but the other side was a shop a shop that sold china it was not an antique shop it had no little shelves of glass vases or mugs it was a shop that sold modern goods and the show window that gave on the street was at the present moment housing every shade of the rainbow a tea set of largish cups and saucers each one of a different colour blue red yellow green pink purple really mr satterthwaite thought a wonderful show of colour no wonder it had struck his eye as the car had passed slowly beside the pavement looking ahead for any sign of a garage or a service station it was labelled with a large card as a harlequin tea set it was the word harlequin of course which had remained fixed in mr satterthwaites mind although just far enough back in his mind so that it had been difficult to recall it the gay colours the harlequin colours and he had thought wondered had the absurd but exciting idea that in some way here was a call to him to him specially here perhaps eating a meal or purchasing cups and saucers might be his own old friend mr harley quin how many years was it since he had last seen mr quin a large number of years was it the day he had seen mr quin walking away from him down a country lane lovers lane they had called it he had always expected to see mr quin again once a year at least possibly twice a year but no that had not happened and so today he had had the wonderful and surprising idea that here in the village of kingsbourne ducis he might once again find mr harley quin absurd of me said mr satterthwaite quite absurd of me really the ideas one has as one gets old he had missed mr quin missed something that had been one of the most exciting things in the late years of his life someone who might turn up anywhere and who if he did turn up was always an announcement that something was going to happen something that was going to happen to him no that was not quite right not to him but through him that was the exciting part just from the words that mr quin might utter words things he might show him ideas would come to mr satterthwaite he would see things he would imagine things he would find out things he would deal with something that needed to be dealt with and opposite him would sit mr quin perhaps smiling approval something that mr quin said would start the flow of ideas the active person would be he himself he mr satterthwaite the man with so many old friends a man among whose friends had been duchesses an occasional bishop people that counted especially he had to admit people who had counted in the social world because after all mr satterthwaite had always been a snob he had liked duchesses he had liked knowing old families families who had represented the landed gentry of england for several generations and he had had too an interest in young people not necessarily socially important young people who were in trouble who were in love who were unhappy who needed help because of mr quin mr satterthwaite was enabled to give help and now like an idiot he was looking into an unprepossessing village cafe and a shop for modern china and tea sets and casseroles no doubt all the same said mr satterthwaite to himself i must go in now ive been foolish enough to walk back here i must go in just well just in case theyll be longer i expect doing the car than they say it will be more than ten minutes just in case there was anything interesting inside he looked once more at the window full of china he appreciated suddenly that it was good china well made a good modern product he looked back into the past remembering the duchess of leith he remembered what a wonderful old lady she had been how kind she had been to her maid on the occasion of a very rough sea voyage to the island of corsica she had ministered to her with the kindliness of a ministering angel and only on the next day had she resumed her autocratic bullying manner which the domestics of those days had seemed able to stand quite easily without any sign of rebellion maria yes thats what the duchesss name had been dear old maria leith ah well she had died some years ago but she had had a harlequin breakfast set he remembered yes big round cups in different colours black yellow red and a particularly pernicious shade of puce puce he thought must have been a favourite colour of hers she had had a rockingham tea set he remembered in which the predominating colour had been puce decorated with gold ah sighed mr satterthwaite those were the days well i suppose id better go in perhaps order a cup of coffee or something it will be very full of milk i expect and possibly already sweetened but still one has to pass the time he went in the cafe side was practically empty it was early mr satterthwaite supposed for people to want cups of tea and anyway very few people did want cups of tea nowadays except that is occasionally elderly people in their own homes there was a young couple in the far window and two women gossiping at a table against the back wall i said to her one of them was saying i said you cant do that sort of thing no its not the sort of thing that ill put up with and i said the same to henry and he agreed with me it shot through mr satterthwaites mind that henry must have rather a hard life and that no doubt he had found it always wise to agree whatever the proposition put up to him might be a most unattractive woman with a most unattractive friend he turned his attention to the other side of the building murmuring may i just look round there was quite a pleasant woman in charge and she said oh yes sir weve got a good stock at present mr satterthwaite looked at the coloured cups picked up one or two of them examined the milk jug picked up a china zebra and considered it examined some ashtrays of a fairly pleasing pattern he heard chairs being pushed back and turning his head noted that the two middle aged women still discussing former grievances had paid their bill and were now leaving the shop as they went out of the door a tall man in a dark suit came in he sat down at the table which they had just vacated his back was to mr satterthwaite who thought that he had an attractive back lean strong well muscled but rather dark and sinister looking because there was very little light in the shop mr satterthwaite looked back again at the ashtrays i might buy an ashtray so as not to cause a disappointment to the shop owner he thought as he did so the sun came out suddenly he had not realized that the shop had looked dim because of the lack of sunshine the sun must have been under a cloud for some time it had clouded over he remembered at about the time they had got to the service station but now there was this sudden burst of sunlight it caught up the colours of the china and through a coloured glass window of somewhat ecclesiastical pattern which must mr satterthwaite thought have been left over in the original victorian house the sun came through the window and lit up the dingy cafe in some curious way it lit up the back of the man who had just sat down there instead of a dark black silhouette there was now a festoon of colours red and blue and yellow and suddenly mr satterthwaite realized that he was looking at exactly what he had hoped to find his intuition had not played him false he knew who it was who had just come in and sat down there he knew so well that he had no need to wait until he could look at the face he turned his back on the china went back into the cafe round the corner of the round table and sat down opposite the man who had just come in mr quin said mr satterthwaite i knew somehow it was going to be you mr quin smiled you always know so many things he said its a long time since ive seen you said mr satterthwaite does time matter said mr quin perhaps not you may be right perhaps not may i offer you some refreshment is there any refreshment to be had said mr satterthwaite doubtfully i suppose you must have come in for that purpose one is never quite sure of ones purpose is one said mr quin i am so pleased to see you again said mr satterthwaite id almost forgotten you know i mean forgotten the way you talk the things you say the things you make me think of the things you make me do i make you do you are so wrong you have always known yourself just what you wanted to do and why you want to do them and why you know so well that they have to be done i only feel that when you are here oh no said mr quin lightly i have nothing to do with it i am just as ive often told you i am just passing by that is all today you are passing by through kingsbourne ducis and you are not passing by you are going to a definite place am i right im going to see a very old friend a friend i have not seen for a good many years hes old now somewhat crippled he has had one stroke he has recovered from it quite well but one never knows does he live by himself not now i am glad to say his family have come back from abroad what is left of his family that is they have been living with him now for some months i am glad to be able to come and see them again all together those thats to say that i have seen before and those that i have not seen you mean children children and grandchildren mr satterthwaite sighed just for a moment he was sad that he had had no children and no grandchildren and no great grandchildren himself he did not usually regret it at all they have some special turkish coffee here said mr quin really good of its kind everything else is as you have guessed rather unpalatable but one can always have a cup of turkish coffee can one not let us have one because i suppose you will soon have to get on with your pilgrimage or whatever it is in the doorway came a small black dog he came and sat down by the table and looked up at mr quin your dog said mr satterthwaite yes let me introduce you to hermes he stroked the black dogs head coffee he said tell ali the black dog walked from the table through a door at the back of the shop they heard him give a short incisive bark presently he reappeared and with him came a young man with a very dark complexion wearing an emerald green pullover coffee ali said mr quin two coffees turkish coffee thats right isnt it sir he smiled and disappeared the dog sat down again tell me said mr satterthwaite tell me where youve been and what you have been doing and why i have not seen you for so long i have just told you that time really means nothing it is clear in my mind and i think it is clear in yours the occasion when we last met a very tragic occasion said mr satterthwaite i do not really like to think of it because of death but death is not always a tragedy i have told you that before no said mr satterthwaite perhaps that death the one we are both thinking of was not a tragedy but all the same    but all the same it is life that really matters you are quite right of course said mr quin quite right it is life that matters we do not want someone young someone who is happy or could be happy to die neither of us want that do we that is the reason why we must always save a life when the command comes have you got a command for me me command for you harley quins long sad face brightened into its peculiarly charming smile i have no commands for you mr satterthwaite i have never had commands you yourself know things see things know what to do do them it has nothing to do with me oh yes it has said mr satterthwaite youre not going to change my mind on that point but tell me where have you been during what it is too short to call time well i have been here and there in different countries different climates different adventures but mostly as usual just passing by i think it is more for you to tell me not only what you have been doing but what you are going to do now more about where you are going who you are going to meet your friends what they are like of course i will tell you i should enjoy telling you because i have been wondering thinking you know about these friends i am going to when you have not seen a family for a long time when you have not been closely connected with them for many years it is always a nervous moment when you are going to resume old friendships and old ties you are so right said mr quin the turkish coffee was brought in little cups of oriental pattern ali placed them with a smile and departed mr satterthwaite sipped approvingly as sweet as love as black as night and as hot as hell that is the old arab phrase isnt it harley smiled over his shoulder and nodded yes said mr satterthwaite i must tell you where i am going through what i am doing hardly matters i am going to renew old friendships to make acquaintance with the younger generation tom addison as i have said is a very old friend of mine we did many things together in our young days then as often happens life parted us he was in the diplomatic service went abroad for several foreign posts in turn sometimes i went and stayed with him sometimes i saw him when he was home in england one of his early posts was in spain he married a spanish girl a very beautiful dark girl called pilar he loved her very much they had children two daughters a fair haired baby like her father called lily and a second daughter maria who took after her spanish mother i was lilys godfather naturally i did not see either of the children very often two or three times a year either i gave a party for lily or went to see her at her school she was a sweet and lovely person very devoted to her father and he was very devoted to her but in between these meetings these revivals of friendship we went through some difficult times you will know about it as well as i do i and my contemporaries had difficulties in meeting through the war years lily married a pilot in the air force a fighter pilot until the other day i had even forgotten his name simon gilliatt squadron leader gilliatt he was killed in the war no no no he came through safely after the war he resigned from the air force and he and lily went out to kenya as so many did they settled there and they lived very happily they had a son a little boy called roland later when he was at school in england i saw him once or twice the last time i think was when he was twelve years old a nice boy he had red hair like his father ive not seen him since so i am looking forward to seeing him today he is twenty three twenty four now time goes on so is he married no well not yet ah prospects of marriage well i wondered from something tom addison said in his letter there is a girl cousin the younger daughter maria married the local doctor i never knew her very well it was rather sad she died in childbirth her little girl was called inez a family name chosen by her spanish grandmother as it happens i have only seen inez once since she grew up a dark spanish type very much like her grandmother but i am boring you with all this no i want to hear it it is very interesting to me i wonder why said mr satterthwaite he looked at mr quin with that slight air of suspicion which sometimes came to him you want to know all about this family why so that i can picture it perhaps in my mind well this house i am going to doverton kingsbourne it is called it is quite a beautiful old house not so spectacular as to invite tourists or to be open to visitors on special days just a quiet country house to live in by an englishman who has served his country and comes back to enjoy a mellow life when the age of retirement comes tom was always fond of country life he enjoyed fishing he was a good shot and we had very happy days together in his family home of his boyhood i spent many of my own holidays as a boy at doverton kingsbourne and all through my life i have had that image in my mind no place like doverton kingsbourne no other house to touch it every time i drove near it i would make a detour perhaps and just pass to see the view through a gap in the trees of the long lane that runs in front of the house glimpses of the river where we used to fish and of the house itself and i would remember all the things that tom and i did together he has been a man of action a man who has done things and i i have just been an old bachelor you have been more than that said mr quin you have been a man who made friends who had many friends and who has served his friends well well if i can think that perhaps you are being too kind not at all you are very good company besides the stories you can tell the things youve seen the places you have visited the curious things that have happened in your life you could write a whole book on them said mr quin i should make you the main character in it if i did no you would not said mr quin i am the one who passes by that is all but go on tell me more well this is just a family chronicle that im telling you as i say there were long periods years of time when i did not see any of them but they have been always my old friends i saw tom and pilar until the time when pilar died she died rather young unfortunately lily my godchild inez the quiet doctors daughter who lives in the village with her father    how old is the daughter inez is nineteen or twenty i think i shall be glad to make friends with her so it is on the whole a happy chronicle not entirely lily my godchild the one who went to kenya with her husband was killed there in an automobile accident she was killed outright leaving behind her a baby of barely a year old little roland simon her husband was quite brokenhearted they were an unusually happy couple however the best thing happened to him that could happen i suppose he married again a young widow who was the widow of a squadron leader a friend of his and who also had been left with a baby the same age little timothy and little roland had only two or three months in age between them simons marriage i believe has been quite happy though ive not seen them of course because they continued to live in kenya the boys were brought up like brothers they went to the same school in england and spent their holidays usually in kenya i have not seen them of course for many years well you know what has happened in kenya some people have managed to stay on some people friends of mine have gone to western australia and have settled again happily there with their families some have come home to this country simon gilliatt and his wife and their two children left kenya it was not the same to them and so they came home and accepted the invitation that has always been given them and renewed every year by old tom addison they have come his son in law his son in laws second wife and the two children now grown up boys or rather young men they have come to live as a family there and they are happy toms other grandchild inez horton as i told you lives in the village with her father the doctor and she spends a good deal of her time i gather at doverton kingsbourne with tom addison who is very devoted to his granddaughter they sound all very happy together there he has urged me several times to come there and see meet them all again and so i accepted the invitation just for a weekend it will be sad in some ways to see dear old tom again somewhat crippled with perhaps not a very long expectation of life but still cheerful and gay as far as i can make out and to see also the old house again doverton kingsbourne tied up with all my boyish memories when one has not lived a very eventful life when nothing has happened to one personally and that is true of me the things that remain with you are the friends the houses and the things you did as a child and a boy and a young man there is only one thing that worries me you should not be worried what is it that worries you that i might be disappointed the house one remembers one has dreams of when one might come to see it again it would not be as you remembered it or dreamt it a new wing would have been added the garden would have been altered all sorts of things can have happened to it it is a very long time really since i have been there i think your memories will go with you said mr quin i am glad you are going there i have an idea said mr satterthwaite come with me come with me on this visit you need not fear that youll not be welcome dear tom addison is the most hospitable fellow in the world any friend of mine would immediately be a friend of his come with me you must i insist making an impulsive gesture mr satterthwaite nearly knocked his coffee cup off the table he caught it just in time at that moment the shop door was pushed open ringing its old fashioned bell as it did so a middle aged woman came in she was slightly out of breath and looked somewhat hot she was good looking still with a head of auburn hair only just touched here and there with grey she had that clear ivory coloured skin that so often goes with reddish hair and blue eyes and she had kept her figure well the newcomer swept a quick glance round the cafe and turned immediately into the china shop oh she exclaimed youve still got some of the harlequin cups yes mrs gilliatt we had a new stock arrived in yesterday oh im so pleased i really have been very worried i rushed down here i took one of the boys motorbikes theyd gone off somewhere and i couldnt find either of them but i really had to do something there was an unfortunate accident this morning with some of the cups and weve got people arriving for tea and a party this afternoon so if you can give me a blue and a green and perhaps id better have another red one as well in case thats the worst of these different coloured cups isnt it well i know they do say as its a disadvantage and you cant always replace the particular colour you want mr satterthwaites head had gone over his shoulder now and he was looking with some interest at what was going on mrs gilliatt the shop woman had said but of course he realized it now this must be he rose from his seat half hesitating and then took a step or two into the shop excuse me he said but are you are you mrs gilliatt from doverton kingsbourne oh yes i am beryl gilliatt do you i mean     she looked at him wrinkling her brows a little an attractive woman mr satterthwaite thought rather a hard face perhaps but competent so this was simon gilliatts second wife she hadnt got the beauty of lily but she seemed an attractive woman pleasant and efficient suddenly a smile came to mrs gilliatts face i do believe    yes of course my father in law tom has got a photograph of you and you must be the guest we are expecting this afternoon you must be mr satterthwaite exactly said mr satterthwaite that is who i am but i shall have to apologize very much for being so much later in arriving than i said but unfortunately my car has had a breakdown its in the garage now being attended to oh how miserable for you but what a shame but its not tea time yet dont worry weve put it off anyway as you probably heard i ran down to replace a few cups which unfortunately got swept off a table this morning whenever one has anyone to lunch or tea or dinner something like that always happens there you are mrs gilliatt said the woman in the shop ill wrap them up in here shall i put them in a box for you no if youll just put some paper around them and put them in this shopping bag of mine theyll be quite all right that way if you are returning to doverton kingsbourne said mr satterthwaite i could give you a lift in my car it will be arriving from the garage any moment now thats very kind of you i wish really i could accept but ive simply got to take the motorbike back the boys will be miserable without it theyre going somewhere this evening let me introduce you said mr satterthwaite he turned towards mr quin who had risen to his feet and was now standing quite near this is an old friend of mine mr harley quin whom i have just happened to run across here ive been trying to persuade him to come along to doverton kingsbourne would it be possible do you think for tom to put up yet another guest for tonight oh im sure it would be quite all right said beryl gilliatt im sure hed be delighted to see another friend of yours perhaps its a friend of his as well no said mr quin ive never met mr addison though ive often heard my friend mr satterthwaite speak of him well then do let mr satterthwaite bring you we should be delighted i am very sorry said mr quin unfortunately i have another engagement indeed  he looked at his watch  i must start for it immediately i am late already which is what comes of meeting old friends here you are mrs gilliatt said the saleswoman itll be quite all right i think in your bag beryl gilliatt put the parcel carefully into the bag she was carrying then said to mr satterthwaite well see you presently tea isnt until quarter past five so dont worry im so pleased to meet you at last having heard so much about you always both from simon and from my father in law she said a hurried goodbye to mr quin and went out of the shop bit of a hurry shes in isnt she said the shop woman but shes always like that gets through a lot in a day id say the sound of the bicycle outside was heard as it revved up quite a character isnt she said mr satterthwaite it would seem so said mr quin and i really cant persuade you im only passing by said mr quin and when shall i see you again i wonder now oh it will not be very long said mr quin i think you will recognize me when you do see me have you nothing more nothing more to tell me nothing more to explain to explain what to explain why i have met you here you are a man of considerable knowledge said mr quin one word might mean something to you i think it would and it might come in useful what word daltonism said mr quin he smiled i dont think  mr satterthwaite frowned for a moment yes yes i do know only just for the moment i cant remember    goodbye for the present said mr quin here is your car at that moment the car was indeed pulling up by the post office door mr satterthwaite went out to it he was anxious not to waste more time and keep his hosts waiting longer than need be but he was sad all the same at saying goodbye to his friend there is nothing i can do for you he said and his tone was almost wistful nothing you can do for me for someone else i think so very likely i hope i know what you mean i have the utmost faith in you said mr quin you always know things you are very quick to observe and to know the meaning of things you have not changed i assure you his hand rested for a moment on mr satterthwaites shoulder then he walked out and proceeded briskly down the village street in the opposite direction to doverton kingsbourne mr satterthwaite got into his car i hope we shant have any more trouble he said his chauffeur reassured him its no distance from here sir three or four miles at most and shes running beautifully now he ran the car a little way along the street and turned where the road widened so as to return the way he had just come he said again only three or four miles mr satterthwaite said again daltonism it still didnt mean anything to him but yet he felt it should it was a word hed heard used before doverton kingsbourne said mr satterthwaite to himself he said it very softly under his breath the two words still meant to him what they had always meant a place of joyous reunion a place where he couldnt get there too quickly a place where he was going to enjoy himself even though so many of those whom he had known would not be there any longer but tom would be there his old friend tom and he thought again of the grass and the lake and the river and the things they had done together as boys tea was set out upon the lawn steps led out from the french windows in the drawing room and down to where a big copper beech at one side and a cedar of lebanon on the other made the setting for the afternoon scene there were two painted and carved white tables and various garden chairs upright ones with coloured cushions and lounging ones where you could lean back and stretch your feet out and sleep if you wished to do so some of them had hoods over them to guard you from the sun it was a beautiful early evening and the green of the grass was a soft deep colour the golden light came through the copper beech and the cedar showed the lines of its beauty against a soft pinkish golden sky tom addison was waiting for his guest in a long basket chair his feet up mr satterthwaite noted with some amusement what he remembered from many other occasions of meeting his host he had comfortable bedroom slippers suited to his slightly swollen gouty feet and the shoes were odd ones one red and one green good old tom thought mr satterthwaite he hasnt changed just the same and he thought what an idiot i am of course i know what that word meant why didnt i think of it at once thought you were never going to turn up you old devil said tom addison he was still a handsome old man a broad face with deep set twinkling grey eyes shoulders that were still square and gave him a look of power every line in his face seemed a line of good humour and of affectionate welcome he never changes thought mr satterthwaite cant get up to greet you said tom addison takes two strong men and a stick to get me on my feet now do you know our little crowd or dont you you know simon of course of course i do its a good few years since ive seen you but you havent changed much squadron leader simon gilliatt was a lean handsome man with a mop of red hair sorry you never came to see us when we were in kenya he said youd have enjoyed yourself lots of things we could have shown you ah well one cant see what the future may bring i thought id lay my bones in that country weve got a very nice churchyard here said tom addison nobodys ruined our church yet by restoring it and we havent very much new building round about so theres plenty of room in the churchyard still we havent had one of these terrible additions of a new intake of graves what a gloomy conversation youre having said beryl gilliatt smiling these are our boys she said but you know them already dont you mr satterthwaite i dont think id have known them now said mr satterthwaite indeed the last time he had seen the two boys was on a day when he had taken them out from their prep school although there was no relationship between them they had had different fathers and mothers yet the boys could have been and often were taken for brothers they were about the same height and they both had red hair roland presumably having inherited it from his father and timothy from his auburn haired mother there seemed also to be a kind of comradeship between them yet really mr satterthwaite thought they were very different the difference was clearer now when they were he supposed between twenty two and twenty five years old he could see no resemblance in roland to his grandfather nor apart from his red hair did he look like his father mr satterthwaite had wondered sometimes whether the boy would look like lily his dead mother but there again he could see little resemblance if anything timothy looked more as a son of lilys might have looked the fair skin and the high forehead and a delicacy of bone structure at his elbow a soft deep voice said im inez i dont expect you remember me it was quite a long time ago when i saw you a beautiful girl mr satterthwaite thought at once a dark type he cast his mind back a long way to the days when he had come to be best man at tom addisons wedding to pilar she showed her spanish blood he thought the carriage of her head and the dark aristocratic beauty her father dr horton was standing just behind her he looked much older than when mr satterthwaite had seen him last a nice man and kindly a good general practitioner unambitious but reliable and devoted mr satterthwaite thought to his daughter he was obviously immensely proud of her mr satterthwaite felt an enormous happiness creeping over him all these people he thought although some of them strange to him it seemed like friends he had already known the dark beautiful girl the two red haired boys beryl gilliatt fussing over the tea tray arranging cups and saucers beckoning to a maid from the house to bring out cakes and plates of sandwiches a splendid tea there were chairs that pulled up to the tables so that you could sit comfortably eating all you wanted to eat the boys settled themselves inviting mr satterthwaite to sit between them he was pleased at that he had already planned in his own mind that it was the boys he wanted to talk to first to see how much they recalled to him tom addison in the old days and he thought lily how i wish lily could be here now here he was thought mr satterthwaite here he was back in his boyhood here where he had come and been welcomed by toms father and mother an aunt or so too there had been and a great uncle and cousins and now well there were not so many in this family but it was a family tom in his bedroom slippers one red one green old but still merry and happy happy in those who were spread round him and here was doverton just or almost just as it had been not quite so well kept up perhaps but the lawn was in good condition and down there he could see the gleam of the river through the trees and the trees too more trees than there had been and the house needing perhaps another coat of paint but not too badly after all tom addison was a rich man well provided for owning a large quantity of land a man with simple tastes who spent enough to keep his place up but was not a spendthrift in other ways he seldom travelled or went abroad nowadays but he entertained not big parties just friends friends who came to stay friends who usually had some connection going back into the past a friendly house he turned a little in his chair drawing it away from the table and turning it sideways so that he could see better the view down to the river down there was the mill of course and beyond the other side there were fields and in one of the fields it amused him to see a kind of scarecrow a dark figure on which birds were settling on the straw just for a moment he thought it looked like mr harley quin perhaps thought mr satterthwaite it is my friend mr quin it was an absurd idea and yet if someone had piled up the scarecrow and tried to make it look like mr quin it could have had the sort of slender elegance that was foreign to most scarecrows one saw are you looking at our scarecrow said timothy weve got a name for him you know we call him mister harley barley do you indeed said mr satterthwaite dear me i find that very interesting why do you find it interesting said roly with some curiosity well because it rather resembles someone that i know whose name happens to be harley his first name that is the boys began singing harley barley stands on guard harley barley takes things hard guards the ricks and guards the hay keeps the trespassers away cucumber sandwich mr satterthwaite said beryl gilliatt or do you prefer a homemade pt one mr satterthwaite accepted the homemade pt she deposited by his side a puce cup the same colour as he had admired in the shop how gay it looked all that tea set on the table yellow red blue green and all the rest of it he wondered if each one had their favourite colour timothy he noticed had a red cup roland had a yellow one beside timothys cup was an object mr satterthwaite could not at first identify then he saw it was a meerschaum pipe it was years since mr satterthwaite had thought of or seen a meerschaum pipe roland noticing what he was looking at said tim brought that back from germany when he went hes killing himself with cancer smoking his pipe all the time dont you smoke roland no im not one for smoking i dont smoke cigarettes and i dont smoke pot either inez came to the table and sat down the other side of him both the young men pressed food upon her they started a laughing conversation together mr satterthwaite felt very happy among these young people not that they took very much notice of him apart from their natural politeness but he liked hearing them he liked too making up his judgement about them he thought he was almost sure that both the young men were in love with inez well it was not surprising propinquity brings these things about they had come to live here with their grandfather a beautiful girl rolands first cousin was living almost next door mr satterthwaite turned his head he could just see the house through the trees where it poked up from the road just beyond the front gate that was the same house that dr horton had lived in last time he came here seven or eight years ago he looked at inez he wondered which of the two young men she preferred or whether her affections were already engaged elsewhere there was no reason why she should fall in love with one of these two attractive young specimens of the male race having eaten as much as he wanted it was not very much mr satterthwaite drew his chair back altering its angle a little so that he could look all round him mrs gilliatt was still busy very much the housewife he thought making perhaps rather more of a fuss than she need of domesticity continually offering people cakes taking their cups away and replenishing them handing things round somehow he thought it would be more pleasant and more informal if she let people help themselves he wished she was not so busy a hostess he looked up to the place where tom addison lay stretched out in his chair tom addison was also watching beryl gilliatt mr satterthwaite thought to himself he doesnt like her no tom doesnt like her well perhaps thats to be expected after all beryl had taken the place of his own daughter of simon gilliatts first wife lily my beautiful lily thought mr satterthwaite again and wondered why for some reason he felt that although he could not see anyone like her yet lily in some strange way was here she was here at this tea party i suppose one begins to imagine these things as one gets old said mr satterthwaite after all why shouldnt lily be here to see her son he looked affectionately at timothy and then suddenly realized that he was not looking at lilys son roland was lilys son timothy was beryls son i believe lily knows im here i believe shed like to speak to me said mr satterthwaite oh dear oh dear i mustnt start imagining foolish things for some reason he looked again at the scarecrow it didnt look like a scarecrow now it looked like mr harley quin some tricks of the light of the sunset were providing it with colour and there was a black dog like hermes chasing the birds colour said mr satterthwaite and looked again at the table and the tea set and the people having tea why am i here said mr satterthwaite to himself why am i here and what ought i to be doing theres a reason    now he knew he felt there was something some crisis something affecting affecting all these people or only some of them beryl gilliatt mrs gilliatt she was nervous about something on edge tom nothing wrong with tom he wasnt affected a lucky man to own this beauty to own doverton and to have a grandson so that when he died all this would come to roland all this would be rolands was tom hoping that roland would marry inez or would he have a fear of first cousins marrying though throughout history mr satterthwaite thought brothers had married sisters with no ill result nothing must happen said mr satterthwaite nothing must happen i must prevent it really his thoughts were the thoughts of a madman a peaceful scene a tea set the varying colours of the harlequin cups he looked at the white meerschaum pipe lying against the red of the cup beryl gilliatt said something to timothy timothy nodded got up and went off towards the house beryl removed some empty plates from the table adjusted a chair or two murmured something to roland who went across and offered a frosted cake to dr horton mr satterthwaite watched her he had to watch her the sweep of her sleeve as she passed the table he saw a red cup get pushed off the table it broke on the iron feet of a chair he heard her little exclamation as she picked up the bits she went to the tea tray came back and placed on the table a pale blue cup and saucer she replaced the meerschaum pipe putting it close against it she brought the teapot and poured tea then she moved away the table was untenanted now inez also had got up and left it gone to speak to her grandfather i dont understand said mr satterthwaite to himself somethings going to happen whats going to happen a table with different coloured cups round and yes timothy his red hair glowing in the sun red hair glowing with that same tint that attractive sideways wave that simon gilliatts hair had always had timothy coming back standing a moment looking at the table with a slightly puzzled eye then going to where the meerschaum pipe rested against the pale blue cup inez came back then she laughed suddenly and she said timothy youre drinking your tea out of the wrong cup the blue cups mine yours is the red one and timothy said dont be silly inez i know my own cup its got sugar in it and you wont like it nonsense this is my cup the meerschaums up against it it came to mr satterthwaite then a shock was he mad was he imagining things was any of this real he got up he walked quickly towards the table and as timothy raised the blue cup to his lips he shouted dont drink that he called dont drink it i say timothy turned a surprised face mr satterthwaite turned his head dr horton rather startled got up from his seat and was coming near whats the matter satterthwaite that cup theres something wrong about it said mr satterthwaite dont let the boy drink from it horton stared at it my dear fellow  i know what im saying the red cup was his said mr satterthwaite and the red cups broken its been replaced with a blue one he doesnt know the red from blue does he dr horton looked puzzled dyou mean dyou mean like tom tom addison hes colour blind you know that dont you oh yes of course we all know that thats why hes got odd shoes on today he never knew red from green this boy is the same but but surely not anyway theres never been any sign of it in in roland there might be though mightnt there said mr satterthwaite im right in thinking daltonism thats what they call it dont they it was a name they used to call it by yes its not inherited by a female but it passes through the female lily wasnt colour blind but lilys son might easily be colour blind but my dear satterthwaite timothy isnt lilys son roly is lilys son i know theyre rather alike same age same coloured hair and things but well perhaps you dont remember no said mr satterthwaite i shouldnt have remembered but i know now i can see the resemblance too rolands beryls son they were both babies werent they when simon remarried it is very easy for a woman looking after two babies especially if both of them were going to have red hair timothys lilys son and roland is beryls son beryls and christopher edens there is no reason why he should be colour blind i know it i tell you i know it he saw dr hortons eyes go from one to the other timothy not catching what they said but standing holding the blue cup and looking puzzled i saw her buy it said mr satterthwaite listen to me man you must listen to me youve known me for some years you know that i dont make mistakes if i say a thing positively quite true ive never known you make a mistake take that cup away from him said mr satterthwaite take it back to your surgery or take it to an analytic chemist and find out whats in it i saw that woman buy that cup she bought it in the village shop she knew then that she was going to break a red cup replace it by a blue and that timothy would never know that the colours were different i think youre mad satterthwaite but all the same im going to do what you say he advanced on the table stretched out a hand to the blue cup do you mind letting me have a look at that said dr horton of course said timothy he looked slightly surprised i think theres a flaw in the china here you know rather interesting beryl came across the lawn she came quickly and sharply what are you doing whats the matter what is happening nothings the matter said dr horton cheerfully i just want to show the boys a little experiment im going to make with a cup of tea he was looking at her very closely and he saw the expression of fear of terror mr satterthwaite saw the entire change of countenance would you like to come with me satterthwaite just a little experiment you know a matter of testing porcelain and different qualities in it nowadays a very interesting discovery was made lately chatting he walked along the grass mr satterthwaite followed him and the two young men chatting to each other followed him whats the doc up to now roly said timothy i dont know said roland he seems to have got some very extraordinary ideas oh well we shall hear about it later i expect lets go and get our bikes beryl gilliatt turned abruptly she retraced her steps rapidly up the lawn towards the house tom addison called to her anything the matter beryl something id forgotten said beryl gilliatt thats all tom addison looked inquiringly towards simon gilliatt anything wrong with your wife he said beryl oh no not that i know of i expect its some little thing or other that shes forgotten nothing i can do for you beryl he called no no ill be back later she turned her head half sideways looking at the old man lying back in the chair she spoke suddenly and vehemently you silly old fool youve got the wrong shoes on again today they dont match do you know youve got one shoe thats red and one shoe thats green ah done it again have i said tom addison they look exactly the same colour to me you know its odd isnt it but there it is she went past him her steps quickening presently mr satterthwaite and dr horton reached the gate that led out into the roadway they heard a motor bicycle speeding along shes gone said dr horton shes run for it we ought to have stopped her i suppose do you think shell come back no said mr satterthwaite i dont think shell come back perhaps he said thoughtfully its best left that way you mean its an old house said mr satterthwaite and old family a good family a lot of good people in it one doesnt want trouble scandal everything brought upon it best to let her go i think tom addison never liked her said dr horton never he was always polite and kind but he didnt like her and theres the boy to think of said mr satterthwaite the boy you mean the other boy roland this way he neednt know about what his mother was trying to do why did she do it why on earth did she do it youve no doubt now that she did said mr satterthwaite no ive no doubt now i saw her face satterthwaite when she looked at me i knew then that what youd said was truth but why greed i suppose said mr satterthwaite she hadnt any money of her own i believe her husband christopher eden was a nice chap by all accounts but he hadnt anything in the way of means but tom addisons grandchild has got big money coming to him a lot of money property all around here has appreciated enormously ive no doubt that tom addison will leave the bulk of what he has to his grandson she wanted it for her own son and through her own son of course for herself she is a greedy woman mr satterthwaite turned his head back suddenly somethings on fire over there he said good lord so it is oh its the scarecrow down in the field some young chap or others set fire to it i suppose but theres nothing to worry about there are no ricks or anything anywhere near itll just burn itself out yes said mr satterthwaite well you go on doctor you dont need me to help you in your tests ive no doubt of what i shall find i dont mean the exact substance but i have come to your belief that this blue cup holds death mr satterthwaite had turned back through the gate he was going now down in the direction where the scarecrow was burning behind it was the sunset a remarkable sunset that evening its colours illuminated the air round it illuminated the burning scarecrow so thats the way youve chosen to go said mr satterthwaite he looked slightly startled then for in the neighbourhood of the flames he saw the tall slight figure of a woman a woman dressed in some pale mother of pearl colouring she was walking in the direction of mr satterthwaite he stopped dead watching lily he said lily he saw her quite plainly now it was lily walking towards him too far away for him to see her face but he knew very well who it was just for a moment or two he wondered whether anyone else would see her or whether the sight was only for him he said not very loud only in a whisper its all right lily your son is safe she stopped then she raised one hand to her lips he didnt see her smile but he knew she was smiling she kissed her hand and waved it to him and then she turned she walked back towards where the scarecrow was disintegrating into a mass of ashes shes going away again said mr satterthwaite to himself shes going away with him theyre walking away together they belong to the same world of course they only come those sort of people they only come when its a case of love or death or both he wouldnt see lily again he supposed but he wondered how soon he would meet mr quin again he turned then and went back across the lawn towards the tea table and the harlequin tea set and beyond that to his old friend tom addison beryl wouldnt come back he was sure of it doverton kingsbourne was safe again across the lawn came the small black dog in flying leaps it came to mr satterthwaite panting a little and wagging its tail through its collar was twisted a scrap of paper mr satterthwaite stooped and detached it smoothing it out on it in coloured letters was written a message congratulations to our next meeting hq thank you hermes said mr satterthwaite and watched the black dog flying across the meadow to rejoin the two figures that he himself knew were there but could no longer see
